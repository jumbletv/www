In fact, a small part of the beauty industry uses soy ink on the packaging of the products. This type of ink is extracted from soybeans. Unlike petroleum-based ink, soy ink is biodegradable. Soy ink has been around for a long time, as it was invented back in 1970. Today, as many as one-third of American newspapers use soy ink. A Korean skincare brand called Dr. Ceuracle's also prints the labels of their products with soy ink. In this way, toxic emissions are minimized. It also makes recycling the packaging easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"\"\u003eUsing natural ingredients\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMany skincare products and other beauty products you wash off your skin after use. When you do this, chemicals are not broken down, but end up in water supplies and in the ocean. This affects not only our own health, but also sea life. Natural ingredients are not only better for the environment, but also for you skin itself. Therefore, it’s wise to look at the ingredient list of a product before purchasing or using it. Below we have compiled a list of some different natural ingredients that are good for you as a user and for the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e-\tEssential oils, such as orange oil, jojoba oil and lavender oil;\u003cbr\u003e-\tHerbal, floral and plant extracts, such as aloe vera, lavender, calendula, lemongrass, white tea, karanja and Icelandic herbs;\u003cbr\u003e-\tNatural emulsifiers, such as beeswax and wool wax;\u003cbr\u003e-\tNatural dyes, such as E100 derived from turmeric;\u003cbr\u003e-\tNatural fragrances, such as lavender oil, rose petals and rosemary;\u003cbr\u003e-\tVegetable fats and oils, such as argan oil and shea butter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"\"\u003eProduction of biodegradable products\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat many people think about when it comes to acting responsibly is recycling. This is for a reason, as it’s a very important part of treating the earth responsibly. Not all beauty industry packaging is recyclable yet, but it’s becoming more so. In fact, many beauty brands are switching to biodegradable and recyclable packaging. By being able to reuse packaging materials over and over again, we don’t need as much new material as we’re using now, which is a lot better for the environment. Try to look for beauty products with recyclable packaging as much as possible. In this simple way, you are already contributing to improving the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"\"\u003eUsing less water in the ingredients\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWater is a very inexpensive ingredient. Not for nothing do many manufacturers of skin care products use a lot of water in producing them. This not only means that our skin doesn’t get all the nutrients it needs, but the fact that such a large amount of water is being used is also bad for the environment. Therefore, try to look for skin-care products that don’t contain water. Such products come often in the form of a powder. You only need to add a little water yourself, which is ultimately more beneficial for the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"\"\u003eGo for solid liquids\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMost people use liquid products.

Not only do they take up little space, but they are also better for the environment. This is because a shampoo bar, for example, is equivalent to as many as ten bottles of liquid shampoo. Also, the packaging of solid liquids is often made of environmentally friendly materials. A well-known brand that sells solid liquids is LUSH. Their solid liquids include face serums, moisturizers, face wash, foundation and perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"\"\u003eSearch for refillable containers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest polluting factors in the beauty industry is the production of packaging. Fortunately, a solution to this has been found and is becoming increasingly common, namely refillable packaging. A lot of products today are available with the option to refill them when they run out. Think of makeup such as lipstick, foundation and eyeshadow. Even in the area of skin-care products, this option is often available. When you choose refillable packaging, you only need to buy the product packaged in the much-needed material when buying a new one. You can put the product in the refillable container at home, making it easy to use. By applying this solution to many different products, a lot of packaging material is saved, and we are all reducing environmental pollution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, there are many different options you can use to help maintain a responsible beauty industry.

Go further to the middle part above your lips and go back by following the contour of your lips. Proceed the line over your cheek and finish it in the middle of your chin. Done?

Then you should definitely try this hack. The only thing you need is your favourite eyeshadow and an eyelash curler. Put the top of the eyelash curler on your eyelid and start applying eyeshadow above the eyelash curler, in the crease of your eye. After applying, buffer it out with another brush. Now use the handle bit and put it on the outer corner of your eye. Now you’re going to create a wing with the eyeshadow. Apply eyeshadow above the handle bit. You can try and use the bow of the top part of the eyelash curler to connect the two lines, but you can also keep it this way.

Are you happy with the way the wing looks? Then you can use a piece of plastic and gently press it against the concealer. This way you create some sort of mold. Turn the piece of plastic around and recreate the wing on the other side of the plastic. Now you can press the plastic on the lid of your other eye. This way, the wings look exactly the same.

Think of the stars of the era and how they always looked like they had just come fresh from the beach. It’s all about creating structure with your hair to accentuate your natural features and create drama without putting in too much effort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCelebrity hairstyle \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mararoszak/\"\u003eMara Roszak\u003c/a\u003e – responsible for Nicole Kidman’s red carpet looks – gave the trend the ‘90s heartthrob’ name. She debuted the trend on Instagram with a photo of Mariah Krey rocking a short cool blonde bob with choppy layers and close-cropped layers that sat at the nap of the neck. What makes this look ‘90s inspired is its cheekbone-sweeping strands that frame the face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe name is a nod to the inspiration behind the trend – Leonardo DiCaprio’s hair in the hit ‘90s film ‘Romeo + Juliet’.

It’s the classic ‘off-duty’ supermodel chic look that you can wear for a lazy day or running errands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trick to creating this look is by getting your hair wet.

You only need a few sprays to get your hair wet enough for this look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePull your hair back into a seek bun, making sure that you focus on your middle parting. It usually helps to use a brush with denser bristles to flatten your hair and make your middle parting stand out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sleekness for this look comes from using ponytail. Take a generous amount in your hands before applying it directly to your hair, working backwards to flatten any lumps or bumps. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePull out a small strand of hair from each side of your hair. Ideally, this hair should fall around lip-length, but it’ll depend on the length of the layers in your hair. Take a little bit of hair gel to emphasis the shape of the loose strands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can use a hair claw to twist your ponytail into a bun for an effortlessly chic look. This clean and expensive hairstyle works for both short and long-hair, so long as you can get it into the hair claw.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSleek long braided ponytail\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/6-ponytail-hairstyles-ideas\"\u003eThis hairstyle is Sansa Stark meets Ariana Grande. \u003c/a\u003eStart by brushing your hair back into a ponytail with a middle part.

Use the same L’Oreal hair gel from before to give you a sleek look by removing any bumps and flattening your hair – it also helps to add an extra touch of shine to your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemove the hair clip from your side parting and take a small bristle brush to brush-out your fringe, bringing it down behind the back of your ear. You can use a bobby pin to hold it in place before adding an extra touch of hair gel to keep it looking sleek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can leave your hair in a ponytail or give the hairstyle a ‘90s-inspired look by adding a statement hair claw.

We asked our resident haircare expert to have a look at the 5 tips to give her thousands on whether these hair tips are worth incorporating into your regular routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBrush your hair before you go to the shower\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBrushing your hair before going to the shower makes it easier to brush once you’re out of the shower. This hair tip by Valerie is an easy one to incorporate into your routine. By brushing your\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/hair\"\u003e hair \u003c/a\u003ebefore going to the shower, you’re able to remove any knots or tangles in your hair before they become worse with washing. If you have coarse or fine hair, doing this tip can help make your hair smoother and softer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe best comb to use for this would be a wide tooth comb to help separate any tangles in your hair. You can use the same brush again after shampooing and conditioning your hair or to distribute product evenly through your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinish your shower with a cold-water rinse\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eValerie’s second tip is another one we should all be following. While you might love nothing more than a roasting hot shower, it’s not the best thing for your hair. Instead of having to have a cold shower the entire time, you can compromise by finishing your shower with a cold-water rinse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cold water will close the hair cuticles to help your hair maintain its natural shine. Cold water also closes your pores, which keeps your scalp cleaner for longer by controlling grease, dirt, and oil. If you have frizz hair or suffer from pesky flyaways, finishing up your shower with cold water can be a gamechanger. Finishing up with cold water means that your hair is less likely to become hydrated by losing moisture in the heat of your shower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinish your blowdry with a cool shot\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSimilarly, you can use the cool shot feature on your blowdryer when you finish drying your hair. It has similar benefits to using cold-water on your hair and helps to boost its natural shine to give you the best results. \u0026nbsp;Using the cold feature on your blowdry also helps to close your cuticles to prevent flyaways and give you smoother hair. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever way you’re styling your hair, using this hair hack tip can be a gamechanger for giving you healthier and more luxurious hair. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWash your hair less – it will become less greasy over time\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis haircare tip is one that we subscribe to. You don’t need to be washing your hair every other day – in fact, it’s likely doing more harm than good for your hair. Your hair naturally gets into a routine with your shampooing schedule, which ends up impacting the way your scalp produces oils and how quickly it becomes greasy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you always wash your hair every other day, it’ll become greasier quicker. You can break the cycle by leaving longer between every wash. While this might take some time for your hair to adjust to, it’s worth it in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOnly apply conditioner to your mids/ends of your hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest mistakes that people make with their haircare routine is when they apply their conditioner to their scalp. Not only is this wasting your expensive haircare products, but it also simply adds to the oils in your scalp and makes your hair appear greaser quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, focus your conditioner from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair. You can use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb for an even application through the lengths of your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese 5 hair tips from TikTok are the perfect basic haircare tips to incorporate into your everyday routine. It’s small hair hacks like these that can be a gamechanger to your haircare routine and help you smash your haircare goals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is your number one haircare hack that you’ve seen on TikTok?

Powder foundations are likely to cake around your under-eye area and make it look even more visible. Look out for a formula that is buildable, as this can allow you to focus it more on your imperfections, while leaving the rest of your face with a lighter coverage for a more natural look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUse your ring finger to gently pat your liquid foundation around your under-eye area. Resist the temptation to use a beauty blender or a brush to speed up this process. Your liquid foundation is the all-important base layer for this\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/make-up\"\u003e makeup.\u003c/a\u003e You can start by applying it to your under-eye area before working on the rest of your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2.\tSolid/pot concealer\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile liquid foundation is our go-to, you want to use a solid or pot concealer. This allows you to create a more targeted and buildable look. Use a small concealer brush to place the concealer over your under-eye area, focusing from the inner corner outwards. Once you’ve placed the concealer down, blend it out using your ring finger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA pot or solid concealer gives you the freedom of applying it using a makeup brush and often gives you a more buildable coverage. When you’re using your makeup brush, make sure that you’re applying and blending the concealer using upward motions to help lift your under-eye area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3.\tTranslucent powder\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe most important step of all with this beauty hack is to apply translucent powder. This helps to minimize the appearance of your under-eyes, brighten the area, and set your foundation and concealer in place. You want to try and apply your translucent powder right after using your concealer for a seamless look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApply your translucent powder with a shader brush before blending it in using the same brush. You want to lightly dust the brush against your skin to avoid over-blending it. You can also use your translucent powder to help set the rest of your makeup to avoid creasing throughout the day for a flawless look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTranslucent powder is available in a ‘clear’ finish, or you can opt for a setting powder that has a hit of colour to help brighten your under-eye area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVoila!

You can think of this article as the five founding principles that govern the world of\u003ca href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/black-skincare-expert-recommended-products\"\u003e black skincare.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour skin doesn’t need aggressive treatments\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the first misconceptions that we need to address is the belief that black skin is tougher and more resilient to aggressive treatments. This concept often leads to people trying harsher treatments or not starting with smaller doses of active ingredients. In reality, the opposite is true. As black skin has melanin cells it can become discoloured quicker, making the skin more fragile than most people understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith this misconception, people end up damaging their skin by using the wrong treatments. If you’re serious about your skincare journey and caring for black skin, it’s always a good idea to see a \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-most-popular-questions-every-dermatologist-gets-asked-and-the-answers\"\u003eprofessional dermatologist. \u003c/a\u003eThey’ll be able to give you an overview of your skin and recommend which treatments will be best for you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour skin deserves a regime that is tailored just to it – instead of a copy and pasted skincare routine from YouTube. Skip the aggressive treatments unless they’re recommended by a dermatologist to tackle a specific issue and only if it’s suitable for your skin type.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou don’t have to shy away from ingredients\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother misconception is that having black skin means you can’t use certain treatments or i\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/everything-that-you-need-to-know-about-retinol\"\u003engredients. \u003c/a\u003eThe skincare world is open to everyone – regardless of complexion. You have to approach skincare with the mindset that every ingredient is available for you, but that doesn’t mean you should use them. You want to choose ingredients and treatments that are tailored to the needs of your skin. For example, you can still enough a chemical peel when you have black skin, but you want to use a lower percentage of the active ingredients. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSkincare is open to everyone; it’s just about finding a way to make it your own. Your skin is just as unique as you are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour skin is likely drier than other complexions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBlack skin is usually drier than lighter skin due to what occurs below the skin’s surface. It has fewer ceramides in the skin’s upper layers, which act as a protective film to keep your skin hydrated by retaining moisture throughout the day. If you don’t have enough ceramides, your skin will become clinically dry as it loses its moisture and becomes dehydrated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the best pieces of advice that we can give you is that oil shouldn’t be used as a moisturiser. If you’re suffering from dry skin, you need to give it a tall glass of water – and oil doesn’t fit that bill. Hyaluronic acid is your best friend and it’s worthwhile investing in a heavy moisturiser that locks-in hydration and keeps your skin protected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can still have laser treatments.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLaser treatments have come on leaps and bounds in recent years – meaning that black skin can now benefit from the help of lasers without worrying about causing skin damage. It’s always best to speak to your technician ahead of time, but most black women can enjoy laser treatments without the risk of developing hyperpigmentation on their skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eGive injectables a try\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne product that isn’t promoted to black women enough is the world of injectables, especially in a skincare context. While lip filler can give you bigger lips, it can also add much-needed hydration to diminish the appearance of lips and repair the skin on your lips. If you’re concerned about premature aging or want to get rid of stubborn wrinkles, injectables will always give you better results than anything you can achieve from a traditional skincare product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these black skincare tips will you be trying out?

We think it’s one of the easiest methods to recreate at home and is fairly fool proof.

Lay the pin flat against your skin and gently dab to apply it to your cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might decide that you want a little more control over your faux freckles.

Using dots will give you a more natural appearance for your freckles and allow you to control the placement. You want to focus the dots on the areas of your face where the sun would naturally hit. These include your cheekbones, nose, and forehead. Diffuse the dots as you move outwards, while also ensuring that you don’t apply them too symmetrically. Your faux freckles should look like sisters, not twins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDab and blend your freckles\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour freckles shouldn’t look perfectly uniformed.

You can follow the same line that you would use to create \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/meet-the-reverse-cat-eye-trend-that-will-upgrade-your-eyeliner-game\"\u003ea cat-eye liner look. \u003c/a\u003eFollow up by patting the concealer along the side of your nose, including just below the inner corner of your eye. Add concealer in a diagonal line directly under where your contour while be applied, as well as below the curve of your lips. You can use a large powder blush to blend the concealer for a flawless finish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake the white line and trace over the areas that you applied the original concealer, along with your brow bone. You can blend the pigment with your fingers for a seamless look. Once you’ve completed these steps, you can apply your contouring as normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the face-lift hack?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/tiktok-face-lift-concealer-trick\"\u003eface-lift hack\u003c/a\u003e (also known as ‘blush sandwich’) revolves around using a concealer and other products to give the illusion of a lifting effect to your skin. While this TikTok video used a white liner and contour, you can also use a highlighter and blush for the same effect. The beauty of this makeup technique is that it is flexible and puts you in control of how you want to lift your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe premise of this makeup technique is that you’re essential stacking your makeup products and nailing the placement at the same time. You’ll notice that everyone doing this trend is placing their blush higher than most of us would do on a daily basis. Instead of applying the blush on the apples of your cheek, your contour goes on the hallows of your cheeks with your blush on top of it. In this sense, the technique is comparable to the ‘draping’ technique that was all over Instagram in spring and summer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sephora.fr/shop/maquillage/teint/anti-cerne-et-correcteur-c352/\"\u003eConcealer\u003c/a\u003e is the difference between the face-lift and draping techniques. You apply the concealer by blending it up and out from your eyes to create the illusion of a natural-looking highlighter. You blend each product up towards your temples to give you a lifted look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDoes this makeup hack live up to the hype?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t knock it till you try it! We love this \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/make-up\"\u003emakeup trend \u003c/a\u003eas it’s an innovative way to give the illusion of a slimmer face without packing on contour. What makes this technique special is how it changes the placement of your products. By moving where you place your blush, you’re able to face your face shape and give the illusion of higher cheekbones for a slimmer face. By applying your blush higher, you’re also able to make your cheeks appear more lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe one thing to consider about this makeup technique is how it looks in real life. While you might look amazing face-on, this technique can easily be overdone and give your face a fake look from the side if you take the pigments too high up your temple. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re starting with this makeup technique, we recommend beginning by applying each step separately – like how Justine did in her TikTok video. While the stacking concept is innovative in and of itself, doing each step individually gives you more control and ensures that you’re applying everything correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is your favourite makeup technique that has gone viral on TikTok?

It’s a unique innovation that offers something for every skincare user.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is microdosing?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile microdosing is becoming a growing trend within the industry, it’s not a new phenomenon. When you hear the word ‘microdosing’, chances are you’re thinking of psychedelic drugs like LSD. What microdosing does is use smaller micrograms of the substance, giving the user the focus and mental health benefits without the ‘high’ side effects that come with a larger amount of the substance being used. The concept of microdosing has been around in the healthcare sphere for decades but has finally made\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/beauty-industry\"\u003e its way into the beauty and skincare industry.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe concept of microdosing with skincare ingredients is to avoid using high concentrations that can cause irritation. Microdosing is using a lower percentage, usually around one-tenth of the concentration, and applying it regularly. Using a microdosing amount means that your skin can grow its tolerance and maintain its protective barrier, while getting the benefits of the ingredients to create a healthy, dewy glow. With microdosing, you can use active ingredients daily instead of every few days. You get all the benefits with the ease of using a lower concentration. If you have \u003ca href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-disorders/sensitive-skin#irritant-contact-dermatitis\"\u003esensitive skin\u003c/a\u003e, microdosing might be the answer to all your problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty industry is looking at microdosing as a therapeutic way of helping you incorporate valuable but easy-to-oversee ingredients. These types of active ingredients include \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/heres-why-your-skin-needs-vitamin-c\"\u003evitamin C\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/what-is-hyaluronic-acid-and-how-should-you-use-it\"\u003eexfoliating acids\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/everything-that-you-need-to-know-about-retinol\"\u003eretinoids\u003c/a\u003e. These active ingredients can be a game changer for your routine but it’s easy to go overboard and have an adverse reaction to them. They’re also notorious for being difficult to layer with other active ingredients. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBy microdosing instead of jumping off at the deep end, you can avoid the adverse side effects of using active ingredients, such as redness, irritation, and flaking. Microdosing allows you to slowly build up your skin’s tolerance to the active ingredient to prevent side effects and irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile you might start slowly with a normal product, it’s easy to become overly zealous and go overboard with a high-strength concentration that ends in chaos for your skin. Your skin can only take a certain level and concentration of an active ingredient before it starts to become inflamed in response. This response is the opposite of what you want from your active ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to see your \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/anti-aging/a22850819/best-skincare-routine/\"\u003eskincare routine\u003c/a\u003e as something that develops slowly over time.

Most \u003ca href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/fad/what-is-a-derm\"\u003edermatologists\u003c/a\u003e would agree that looking at the sun or sea for skincare inspiration is rarely the best place to start. The reason? It’s difficult to recreate an ocean in a bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReal ocean water, particularly that which is magnesium-based, can feel like it’s a miracle from your skin. There’s lots of evidence of sea salt water in the ocean effectively exfoliating your skin to cleanse the pores, removing impurities and oils from your skin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe issue is that while this might work in the office, it won’t work in your \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-most-relaxing-bath-ritual-for-self-care\"\u003ebathroom at home\u003c/a\u003e.

That doesn’t mean that we ignore the danger that some of them pose. It’s worth remembering that most DIY skincare solutions either don’t work or can damage your skin. For example, while this sea salt water treatment will work on the surface of your skin, it won’t be able to target the dermis layer of your skin for long-term results. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSalt water does have its benefit. It can soothe mild skin inflammation, including redness and hyperpigmentation. Although it can do this, it’s not considered an appropriate treatment for acne. The real danger posed by this DIY skincare trend is that it will delay people from seeing their dermatologist or result in scarring and hyperpigmentation by using the wrong products for their skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing that we can disprove is the claim in this trend that ocean water balances your skin’s pH level and removes bacteria. Sea water has an alkaline pH of 8 which is similar to that of acne-prone skin. If you wanted to balance acne-prone skin, you would need to use an acidic pH instead, such as \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-most-popular-questions-every-dermatologist-gets-asked-and-the-answers\"\u003esalicylic acid \u003c/a\u003eor\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/what-is-hyaluronic-acid-and-how-should-you-use-it\"\u003e glycolic acid.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile people might be claiming to get visible results from this treatment, it’s not all its made out to be. At its heart, it’s a mild exfoliation and anti-inflammation treatment.

As a result, it’s around 90% of the material that is causing sewer blockages across the UK.

Governments across the world are taking action to reduce the use of plastics, including banning microbeads and cotton buds. The issue with these specific items is that we only use them for a few minutes, before they end up in landfill and take hundreds of years to decompose. If you want to see change, lobby your local politicians to implement more guidance to regulate the use of plastic within the beauty industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not just us who has to make changes – corporations have a role to play to.

The good news is that almost every hue is universally flattering, so it’s a case of choosing a shade that works for your mood and personality.

If you take too much powder onto your brush, it can quickly go from a sculpted look to as though you’re wearing too much fake tan. All it takes is a split second on your brush to mess up your look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s why we’ve long thought of contouring as an art form. Celebrities like \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimkardashian/\"\u003eKim Kardashian\u003c/a\u003e were pivotal at bringing around the revolution of contouring. Do you remember before the pandemic when chiselled contouring was a must-have part of your look?

Instead of the chiselled look of the past, trends are pointing towards a more natural look. You don’t want your contour to dominate your face or make it appear as though you’ve gone to down with your powder. Instead, your contour should accentuate your natural features and help lift and sculpt your face. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sephora.com/shop/bronzer-makeup\"\u003eBronzer \u003c/a\u003eis about creating the illusion of a slimmer face with a healthy glow and definition.

Just like your blush, the placement of your bronzer is the most important step. If you put your bronzer in the wrong place, it can change the shape and appearance of your face. You also want to make sure you blend your bronzer to get rid of any muddy streaks or obvious lines that ruin the illusion of naturally sculpted cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s worth going back to basics and thinking about these two things before jumping into the TikTok hack.

It’s a gamechanger that your makeup routine will love. Nicknamed the ‘one fluid motion bronzer’, this hack focuses around applying your bronzer in just one brush stroke to give you a contoured look in seconds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAll you need for this makeup hack is a cream contour or bronzer (avoid powder as it won’t blend as easily) and a medium-sized makeup brush for your face. These are staples that you likely already have in your makeup bag or vanity. If you don’t, they’re the perfect investment pieces and a must-have for anyone who does their makeup regularly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDuring the makeup hack, the TikTok user talks about how she loves to find easy makeup hacks that allow you to create a look with just one fluid motion of your hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eTo create the one motion look, you need to load your medium-size face brush up with cream bronzer. Place the brush at the outside corner of your eye, travelling along your brow bone, before going down one side of your nose, quickly followed by going up the other side. Carry on applying your bronzer in one fluid motion over your other brow bone, travelling down your cheek, along your jaw, up your opposite cheek, before crossing your forehead and finishing at your temples. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile that might sound complicated, it’s essentially taking the classic ‘3’ shape trick that most people use and re-creates it on both sides of your face in one fluid motion. It’s the perfect makeup hack to use when you’re on the go or in a rush out the door. Trust us. It’s not as complicated as it sounds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou might think that this makeup hack would only give you a subtle contouring look. In reality, you get an impressive bronze glow and sculpted look in just one brush motion. It’s one of the most satisfying makeup hacks that we’ve found in years and so easy to do.

Red represents a new beginning and it’s a way of helping you stand out from the crowd. There’s a reason why one of the most popular transitions is from blonde to copper. Around 2% of the population has red hair naturally, making copper hair an instant way to make a statement. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere has always been a romanticism with red hair. In the 19th-century, women were painted with red hair to give the idea of independence, selfhood, and identity. If you heard stories as a child, the chances are that the female heroine had red hair.

These tools are a better choice for doing the reverse eyeliner trend as you have more control over the colour as you’re applying it under your lower lash line. The easiest way to do this look is to add a dash of liner underneath your lash line, before using an angled brush to wing out the pigment at the corner of your eye, connecting it to your upper eyelid’s wing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat makes this eyeshadow look more seductive is when you use a fluffy brush to blend the liner under your lash line for a smoky look.

While this will keep you cool, the chances are that you’ll be struggling to try to hide your bra strap. Never fear.

It’ll save you investing in a strapless bra and means you don’t have to change your outfit at the last minute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis hack works better than your normal strapless bra. Start by taking your bra and loosen the straps all the way. Make sure that they are as loose as possible on both sides. Take the straps and move them over your head and shoulder to the opposite side of your body. Tuck the loose parts of your bra under the straps to secure them in place. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith this easy TikTok hack, your normal bra will be able to give you better results than a strapless bra, while giving you extra support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrop tops are trending but you don’t need to go out and buy a new one.

Once you have it on at the front, button the shirt the whole way down your back.\u003cbr\u003eThis fashion hack is perfect for a night out when you have ‘nothing to wear’ and don’t want to buy a fast fashion piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave you bought a tank top with straps that are too loose?

While we’re all aware of issues\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/what-is-slow-fashion-and-what-does-it-actually-mean\"\u003e like fast fashion\u003c/a\u003e and controversial ingredients like palm oil, water is one ingredient that you’re probably overlook. Water is something that most of us takes for granted every day. The ability to go into our kitchen and run a tap, receiving instant water, is virtually unheard of in some parts of the world – even in the 21st century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWater is one ingredient that we often turn to for its hydrating and moisturising properties. You might think of it as an everyday ingredient, but one marketing research firm is calling it the “new luxury” ingredient due to demand outstretching supply. Water is about to become a precious commodity across the world as the demand for it begins to outstretch supply and as climate change takes hold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll you have to do is look at the intense water consumption of industries like the fast fashion niche to see how this is happening. In countries like India, most of their water is used for textile production, while millions of people are without safe drinking water.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the population continues to grow, economic development thrives, and consumption increases, the global supply of water is going up with it. Did you know that the average person in the Western world uses 140 litres of water a day, including for washing and household use? Just picture a one litre bottle of water and then times it by one hundred and forty. That’s how much water just you use every day. Now multiple that by how many people live in your house and you’ll quickly see the number start to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s also the impact of climate change to consider. Two thirds of the world’s population are already dealing with water scarcity for at least one month of the year as temperatures start to rise and climates become more humid. With climate change raising the earth’s temperature, we can expect this number to rise as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough agriculture is naturally the main consumer of water usage – taking around\u003ca href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/freshwater-crisis\"\u003e 70% of the world’s resources \u003c/a\u003e– the beauty industry is playing a role in contributing to the problem as well. It’s not just about beauty brands becoming more sustainable or greener, it’s also about making consumers aware of the impact that their products are having.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust think of how we all ditched single used plastic after seeing the harms it causes to our oceans. As more consumers become aware of the dangers of certain ingredients, they start to put pressure on brands to change their practices and look for more sustainable alternatives. They also work to lobby governments and institutions, often causing a change in regulations and even laws. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-microbeads-ban-comes-into-force\"\u003eThe banning of micro-beads in the UK \u003c/a\u003eis a prime example of this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChange is already happening within the industry\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs the world looks to become more sustainable and eco-friendlier, it’s no surprise that beauty companies are already looking for ways to reduce their water consumption. As consumers become more educated, these brands are seeking to get ahead of the curve and out-perform their competition on the axes of sustainability. Even some of the most popular brands within the industry are taking proactive steps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.loreal.com/en/articles/sharing-beauty-with-all/optimised-water-consumption-and-recycling-water-on-site/\"\u003eL’Oreal has pledged to reduce its water consumption by an eye-water 60% \u003c/a\u003eper finished product unit by the end of 2022. When you think of how many products L’Oreal makes, that’s an impressive commitment. Similarly, \u003ca href=\"https://www.unilever.co.uk\"\u003eUnilver \u003c/a\u003ehave set their own goal of halving the environment impact of the production and usage of their products by 2030. This ambitious goal also includes its water usage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat you might not know is that water is one of the leading ingredients in most of the skincare and cosmetics products in your vanity. The next time you’re washing your hair, take a look at the ingredients list on your shampoo and condition. You’ll notice that ‘Aqua’ is almost always one of the first ingredients listed. The ingredients list works by starting with the highest concentration before working its way down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe issue with the beauty industry is that water has been used as a filler ingredient for years to bulk out the product. It’s typically listed as the first ingredient as it forms the base for the product. You might even find that it makes up 70-80% of the product’s formula. One reason why water is chosen as the base is due to its low price point, meaning that it lowers the overall cost of producing the produce, in turn making it more affordable. It’s this view of water as being a ‘cheap’ commodity that leads to people assuming that it’s a limitless resource that will never run out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinding an alternative to water-based formulas\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is that there are already alternatives to water-based formulas on the market. You can vote with your wallet and make the industry change by opting for more sustainable formulas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolid beauty bars are one product that have been on the rise in recent years due to their \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/sustainability\"\u003esustainability\u003c/a\u003e and the fact that they use virtually no packaging and leave zero waste. What we love about solid beauty bars is that they come with a more concentrated formula, meaning that you get more for your money with a lower cost per use. As there is little to no water used, you’re getting more active and skin-loving ingredients in your beauty bar. A beauty bar will naturally lather up when you’re using it in the shower, making it a popular format for shampoos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese beauty bars are more sustainable than you might think, ticking all the boxes for anyone with an \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/5-ways-to-make-your-beauty-routine-more-earth-friendly-and-sustainable\"\u003eeco-friendly conscious.\u003c/a\u003e Think of the big containers that house liquid shampoos. They come covered in plastic – and occasionally even an outer layer of plastic. It uses considerably more plastic than a shampoo bar, which can even be packaged in eco-friendly material like beeswax paper or recycled cardboard. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWater-free beauty products can be stored and packaged in compostable materials or even sold naked. If you’ve ever been to stores like Lush, you’ll see that their soaps do not come individually wrapped in plastic, instead stored in their whole form. Without the need for this plastic packaging, your beauty products have a lower carbon footprint, and the lack of water means that it weighs even less. As it weighs less, it has a knock-on effect by lowering the transportation cost of the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe rise in powder products as an eco-friendly alternative\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou also want to consider swapping out for powder-based products, which are already starting to become a popular niche within the beauty industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile most skincare products come in a liquid format, powder versions of products like cleaners, exfoliators, and face masks are becoming more popular. You activate the ingredients in the product and use it by adding a touch of water to turn them to liquid. You get all the skincare benefits, while reducing the weight and waste of your product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of using powder-based products is that they can maintain the integrity of your active ingredients. \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/heres-why-your-skin-needs-vitamin-c\"\u003eVitamin C\u003c/a\u003e is one active ingredient that can deteriorate overtime if it is pre-mixed with water. If you use vitamin C in its powder form, you can preserve its integrity and purity to make sure that you get the most out of the ingredients when you use them. All it needs is a touch of water to active it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other thing to consider is that the powder form of products means that it can be made without needing to use preservatives, which are one of the leading causes of skin irritation. If you want a cleaner product, with more active ingredients and a less irritating formula, it’s time to shift from water-based liquid formulas to powder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne other bonus of using a beauty bar or powder is that they don’t count towards your liquid allowance while flying. If you’re always on the go, these eco-friendly products can be a lifesaver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOil-based alternatives to water formulas\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe other product type to consider are oils. Most of us assume that water is instantly a good thing. You’ll often see water justified as being in a formula for its hydrating benefits, when it’s really only there for filler. In reality, the minerals and metals in water can strip your skin if you use them too often. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToo much of a good thing can cause problems – with water being no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have sensitive skin or want to cut your water use, swap out for nourishing natural oils instead. You’ll get all the hydrating benefits of the natural ingredients, while the oil will help them absorb seamlessly into your skin. Instead of using water, these oils incorporate things like fruit waters and botanicals to create the same effect without the environmental consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile you might be used to seeing water coming out of your kitchen tap, that’s the exact problem. We’re so used to water that we take it for granted. With new solutions and alternatives coming to the market every year, it might be time to finally cut down our water usage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow are you making your beauty routine more sustainable?

A claw clip is a healthier alternative for your hair than using elastics – whether you’ve got wet or dry hair. You don’t have to worry about breakage, and it can help keep your hair up and out of your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like a traditional hair elastic, you get versatile with a claw clip. You can put it up in a classic twist-up look or take a leaf from Kendal Jenner’s style book and use it for a half-up/half-down look. As hair claws come in different shapes and sizes, you can use a smaller claw to hold back specific pieces of hair to bring definition to your look. Smaller hair claws are perfect for clipping back the sides of your hair to keep it out of your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why claw clips are so popular is that they work for virtually every hair length and texture.

It can help enhance the appearance of your lips, while complementing your skin tone. Like any makeup product, there’s a fine line between finding the perfect nude lipstick and one that leaves you looking washed out and unwell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow do I choose the right nude lipstick for me?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe secret to choosing the best nude \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-ultimate-lip-care-routine-that-everyone-needs-to-follow\"\u003elipstick\u003c/a\u003e for you is to think about your skin tone. If you have a darker skin tone, you want to look at nude shades that have warm or caramel undertones. Stay firmly away from any with a pastel undertone as they will wash you out. If you have oily skin, look for rosy undertones or a mid-level pink. If you have paler skin, look for a nude shade that has hint of brown with a mauve or pink twist. You’ll be able to get away with wearer a lighter pink colour as a nude lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other thing you want to consider is having a lipstick that works with your natural lip colour, adding another dimension to the appear of your lips. Using a lip liner is an easy way to get the most out of your perfect nude lipstick. You can choose one that is in the exact same hue (most brands sell a matching lip liner for their lipsticks) or one that is a few shades on either side of the lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing a lip liner will help add depth and dimension to your lips, leaving them perfectly kissable. Another trick worth knowing is how to use a lip brush to apply your lipstick as if helps you from overapplying too much lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe number one mistake people make when they’re shopping for a new nude lipstick is that they test it on the back of their hand, which usually gets more sun than your face, making it darker.

What we love about nude lipsticks is that they’re low-maintenance and fuss-free, meaning you don’t need to worry about reapplying them constantly. If the lipstick starts to wear away, it leaves a less obvious trace behind on your lips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNude lipstick is also an easy way to give the illusion of plumper lips – even making it look as though you’ve invested in filler.

As though she was from ancient Greek, while still looking as though she was from lightyears in the future. There’s something about copper red that is equal parts timeless and unnatural. It’s a shade that belongs to folklore and fairytale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe red copper hair trend is one of our favourites. Why? It’s one that almost everyone can jump on. Red is a universally flattering shade, meaning that there is a hue out there that will work for you. It’s all about working with your skin’s undertones to find the shade of red that will complement your features and brighten your complexion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-most-popular-hair-colour-of-2021\"\u003eWe’re taking a look at the hottest hair colour trend of 2021\u003c/a\u003e to help you determine whether it’s time to go for a Sansa Stark inspired look. Our Instagram feed is full of celebrities who are giving the look a try, making us think that this trend is here for the long-term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to find the best copper shade for you\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eStart by looking at your wrists \u003ca href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/skin-undertones#undertones\"\u003eto determine the undertones of your skin\u003c/a\u003e. If you have cool undertones, you’ll see blue and purple veins. If you have neutral undertones, you’ll see green and blue. Green and olive hues are a sign of warm undertones to your skin. If you have warm tones to your skin, you’ll naturally have a golden (or sometimes red) tint to your skin. Cooler tones tend to take on a more blue or violent tint to their skin. If you can’t figure out which you are then the chances are that you’re right in the middle as a neutral hue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOnce you know your undertones, go and meet your stylist to talk about finding the perfect complementary shade. You also don’t want to forget to ask them about the best way to maintain your new copper colour. Your salon will usually have a product line that they can recommend that works with the specific formula and dye that they used to achieve your copper hue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most popular hues for copper shades is a bright-auburn. Part of the popularity behind these copper shades is that they’re exciting, unexpected, and something different. All you have to do is look at how popular the \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=copperhair\u0026t=1632304192494\"\u003e#copperhair is on TikTok.\u003c/a\u003e The app dominates all the trends and usually calls the shots on what’s hot and what’s not.

It’s mainly to be able to gain some sense of control over their life. Do you remember the early weeks and months of the pandemic? How many of your friends and family did you see using box dyes to change their hair? At one stage, box dye was one of the hardest beauty products to track down as we all found ways of trying to survive without our trusty hair stylist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen we get emotional, our hair is the first thing we reach for to control.

Her sister Gigi quickly jumped on the trend, posting a photo with long copper auburn hair after her post-maternity debut back on the runway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLike the Hadid sisters have shown, you don’t have to jump off on the deep end with the copper trend. If you have brunette hair, you can even experiment with the hue by using balayage to help add a copper undertone to your hair without making too much of a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of the copper hair trend?

You have to smile – but not too brightly – to help find the so-called perfect placement. What most of us don’t realise is that the placement of your blush can drastically change the appearance of your face. If it’s too low, it can make your face appear longer and fuller. If you raise your blush a little, you can give the illusion of a natural face lift to slim your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis makeup hack by\u003ca href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@meganlavallie/video/6934062971123535109?sender_device=pc\u0026sender_web_id=7005509110524429829\u0026is_from_webapp=v1\u0026is_copy_url=0\"\u003e @meganlavallie\u003c/a\u003e takes you through how to correctly place your blush, depending on your desired look.

It’s an essential for any makeup look – especially the natural beauty trend – whether or not you want to layer it with a powder or foundation.

For a softer look, apply your \u003ca href=\"https://www.laboucherougeparis.fr/teint/la-terre/\"\u003ebronzer \u003c/a\u003eor contour to the area slightly above the hollows of your cheeks.

We often do our makeup under artificial light, making it look different to how it will outside. If you’re sculpting your jaw or nose, this could appear harsher when you’re outside. Instead of focusing on what looks good on your Instagram stories, think about what looks best in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShading with foundation\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA contour stick is every makeup lover’s best friend, but foundation can give you the same effect. The trick is to find a foundation that is half or a full shade darker than your everyday foundation. You can apply it as a contour using a brush or a beauty blender if you want more contour over your look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis style of contouring is ideal for sculpting your cheekbones, forehead, nose, and jawline.

It’s not all about contouring – it also focuses on highlighter and blush. The one product we all reach for when we want to give our skin a healthy glow is blush. All you need is a few strokes of blush to give your skin a natural and healthy appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe secret to applying blush is to make sure it lifts your face. You want to avoid applying it too low on your cheeks. The easiest way to place your blush in the correct place is to smile naturally and apply it to the apple of your cheeks. It will help naturally lift your face. If you want a more contemporary look, you can blend a small amount of blush across your chin, forehead, and nose. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe best products to use for a glowing look are blushes with a cream or liquid formula as they mimic your natural-looking skin. If you’re planning on layering your blush with other products, keep your powder light and focus it on your t-zone to keep your skin’s dewy glow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUse your favourite highlighter\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe third component of the soft sculpting look is highlighter. What makes your highlighter different for soft sculpting is that you don’t want it to look obvious. You want to give the appearance of being lit-from-within by avoiding applying your highlighter too heavy or by adding texture to your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIlluminate your skin and add to its natural radiance. You want to avoid the stripe of highlighter along your cheekbones that is overly visible. If your skin is older, there’s a helpful trick to correctly apply your highlighter. Just like when applying blush, you want to smile softly when applying your highlighter. Smiling means that you can avoid applying your highlighter on the fine lines and wrinkles that form around your eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe same rules apply when choosing your highlighter as they do for blush. Avoid powder formulas and instead choose a liquid highlighter to give you a more natural look. Liquid formulas naturally absorb into your skin, giving you that naturally illuminated look. \u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re aiming for a soft sculpting look, you want to avoid using a powder highlighter. This type of highlighter sits on your skin and gives an artificial look, especially as it sparkles in the sun. These products can give your skin a shiny or greasy texture, instead of the dewy glow that you’re aiming for. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can place your highlighter near where the blush has already been applied. You want to create a ‘gleam’ on your skin by applying it above your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, brow bone, your inner eye, and your cupid’s bow. The secret is to focus on the parts of your face where the sun would naturally hit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSculpting your face\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMakeup is something that is highly personal. No two people apply makeup the same way and everything looks different on different people. A smoky eye might flatter one eye shape and not another. You might find a lipstick that is your perfect match, but that doesn’t compliment the skin tone of your best friend. It’s all about tailoring makeup and trends to suit your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to master the art of makeup, you need to get to know your face. It’s not just about recognising your reflection, but instead knowing how your skin works and what flatters your face. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like any makeup trend, soft sculpting isn’t a one-size-fits-all type of makeup. It’s not a trend that works for every occasion – or even every face. You want to break the soft sculpting trend down into a step-by-step process, focusing on each step individually. \u003cbr\u003eStart by learning how to apply contour to your face and understand which products to use when. While powder works for more dramatic looks, you want to focus on cream and liquid products for a softer look. Apply your chosen product with a light hand to avoid an unnatural finish. It’s best to start small and build the product until you achieve your desired finish. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re working on your blush, make sure to apply it in a way that lifts your face. Chose a cream or liquid blush and smile so that you can apply it to the apples of your cheeks. The same rules apply for your highlighter. Keep it natural and apply it on the spots of your face where the sun naturally shines. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you learn how to do these three steps in a way that suits your face, you’ll master the art of soft sculpting. It’s a way of helping you learn the difference between the makeup we see on social media and ‘real life’ makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",
		"post-summary": "Contouring is one of the biggest trends within the beauty industry. In recent years, we’ve gone from dramatic Kim Kardashian worthy contour to a more natural look. Even Mario Dedivanovic, the go-to makeup artist for the Kardashians sisters, has switched to a light-handed approach for contouring. With beauty trends all pointing towards a ‘natural’ look, it’s no surprise that “soft sculpting” is the trend that everyone is talking about.",

Most of them had to change their show styles, relying heavily on digital presentations or an intimate presentation with only a few models and guest (if any) in attendance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven in the face of adversity, these designers took their creativity and made something beauty. Fall 2021 collections captured the idea of embracing outdoor living, while taking inspiration from the era of the Roaring ‘20s, with the presence of the always timeless little black dress. For fall 2021, designers look at putting comfort first with elevated and effortlessly chic knitwear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’re giving you the ultimate guide for the trends of fall 2021 with eleven different trends that designers have incorporated into their collections.

When you know what you’re looking for, you can find more attainable dupes from your favourite brand.\u003cbr\u003eHere are the eleven different trends that you can expect to see everywhere in fall 2021:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCrop jackets and tops\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne unexpected trend for fall 2021 is crop silhouettes. While we usually think of these as being a spring or summer look, they’ve made a comeback for fall 2021. You’ll spot everything from cropped tops to jackets on the runway. They have a more elegant silhouette, while keeping the midriff-baring shape to the top. Chanel took a chic and sophisticated fuchsia pantsuit down the runway, while \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emiliawickstead/\"\u003eEmilia Wickstead\u003c/a\u003e took a two-piece set and gave it a ladylike feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eComfortable and hygge fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one word that we can use to describe fall 2021 trends, it’s ‘cosy’ or ‘hygge’. You need to remember what the world was like when designers were coming up with the concepts for these collections. What is different about the runway is that these are elevated without a single sweatpant in sight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFashion designers have gone out of their way to incorporate an extra layer of comfort into their designs, whether it’s with shearling-lined coats at Chloe or fuzzy hoodies from Dior. You’ll notice fabric that is plush and oversized, with silhouettes that are tapered while being universally flattering. Comfortable clothing never looked so good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMidi dresses and silhouettes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother trend that has made a reappearance for fall 2021 is midi dresses and skirts. This silhouette has been gaining momentum over recent years as a longer hemline that is more universally flattering. Midi skirts were everywhere we looked during fall 2021 shows, with each designer putting their own twist on the look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDior used a box-pleat for their midi skirts, while Erdem opened for a knife pleat, as The Tow went for a classic a-line silhouette, whereas Partow kept their skirts flowy and feminine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e1920s glamour \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eEmbrace the glamour of the 1920s and channel your inner Daisy Buchanan with this trend. It’s all about layers upon layers of sequins. You can think of this trend as 1920s meets the opulence of the 1980s. If you’ve ever wanted to dance the night away at a jazz bar, this trend is for you. What is unique about it is that the silhouettes are modest and covered up, while incorporating glimmering and sparkling textures into the pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSome of the signature pieces for this trend are high neck jumpers, structured jackets, voluminous dresses, and long trousers. We saw this trend across the board with brands like Loewe, Valentino, Dries Van Noten, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pacorabanne/\"\u003ePaco Rabanne\u003c/a\u003e. These brands each choose to skip the minimalistic aesthetic in favour for a more optimistic and opulent look.\u003cbr\u003eLadies, the roaring ‘20s are back again. It’s time to get your outfit ready for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSaturated colours\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne trend that you’ll see everywhere on the runway – and TikTok – is saturated colours. Colours are making a comeback and we couldn’t be more excited. You want to play with colour that is unexpected and off the beating track. Jil Sander experimented with a mustard hue with a lemon twist, while Miu Miu stuck with a feminine colour palette of bubblegum pink with marigold. At Patou, you’ll see rust and lavender hues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThese colours will turn heads and make you the centre of attention for any event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIt’s all about tailoring\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLet’s just be blunt. Tailoring is back and you need to get it in your life. Designers are no longer just adding a few tailored elements to their pieces. It’s all about tailoring. On the runway, we saw tailored pieces paired and layered over other tailored pieces. It’s clear that the industry is all for tailoring for fall 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInstead of pairing these tailored outfits with on-trend sneakers or even sophisticated pumps, brands are choosing to wear them with loafers and oxford shoes for a masculine twist. If you’re a fan of layering tailored pieces for a smart look, check out the collections of The Row, Tory Burch, Prada, and Peter Do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKnitwear \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIs it even fall if there isn’t knitwear on the runway? One of the biggest fashion lessons from the pandemic is that people want comfortable clothing – without compromising on style. We saw the rise of luxury loungewear with pieces that are equal-parts comfortable and polish. You can bring the aesthetic through to fall 2021 with elevated luxury knitwear. Look out for cashmere and wool two-piece sets and comfortable silhouettes that you can cuddle up with during cold evenings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe saw this trend at brands like Altuzarra, Gabriela Hearst, and Prozena Schouler. \u0026nbsp;If you’re going to invest in anything for fall 2021, let it be luxury knitwear.

Fall 2021 was no exception with Aspres-Ski inspired pieces appearing across almost every runway show. You want to look out for modern classics like a cropped cardigan in a bright hue or a cosy knitwear set that has a statement colour. You want to close your eyes and imagine that you’re about to go out onto the slopes. That’s the style aesthetic that you’re going for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eClassic brands like Balenciaga, Chanel, Miu Miu, and Junya Watanabe have all put comfortable ski sweaters and loungewear at the heart of their fall 2021 collections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePuffer coat\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe puffer coat is one trend that seems to come back every fall and winter, only gaining more momentum every year. You want to look for a puffer coat in a bold colour – like Dolce \u0026amp; Gabbana’s red leopard – to make a statement with your coat. Most of the puffer coats that you’ll find on the runway are high-fashion pieces that are designed to make a statement, while keeping you warm as the temperatures drop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBack to Black\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what happens in the world, you can always rely on a little black dress appearing on the runway. These dresses will never go out of style, even when we hear things like ‘pink is the new black’. If you’re looking to invest in your fall 2021 closet, look no further than a little black dress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll often find that the little black dress is given an update and a new look every season. For fall 2021, the little black dress was kept short and fitted with a sultry look. At Dior, they focused on the babydoll look, while Fashion Eat incorporated tuxedo dresses. Whatever LDB you’re wearing, make sure you’re showing off your legs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these fall 2021 trends will you be recreating?

The only water it needs is what you use while washing or showering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese products also weigh less than plastic bottles, meaning that they cut down on carbon emissions as they take less space during transportation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust this one switch can do all this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUse a hot cloth for your skin instead of face wipes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLet’s get one thing straight.

The UK alone uses 11 billion wet wipes every year – with most of them ending up in landfill or flushed down the toilet, meaning that they end up in our oceans. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the UK, wet wipes account for over 90% of sewer blocks and can even lead to ‘fatbergs’ that build up in rivers, which often include products like sanitary items and facial wipes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing to consider is that facial wipes aren’t good for your skin.

Beauty brands like REN Skincare are leading the way by putting existing plastic to good use by using it for their packaging instead of having to bring more plastic into the world. Their Ocean Plastic bottles are made using plastic that is collected from beaches, riverbanks, and oceans.

Brands like Maybelline and The Body Shop are working with recycling companies to create drop-off locations in their stores and at local kiosks to encourage you to recycle your empty beauty products.

Looking at trends for fall 2021, it’s all about a pop of colour, whether it’s with soft pastels or bright bold hues.

However, that’s a season when most of us adopt a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/article/skinimalism-beauty-trend\"\u003eskinimalistic \u003c/a\u003eapproach and keep everything simple with multi-functional products. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs part of the fall 2021 trends, we can expect the concept of skinimalism to play a big role in every trend. Look out for lightweight products with a breathable formula that help your skin achieve a healthy, dewy glow without weighing down your skin. It’s all about finding a concealer and foundation that offers you buildable coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlthough fall 2021 makeup trends will largely be understated, there will be an element of glamour to them. With face masks being reduced, you can expect a return to the days of glossy lips. Other ‘glamorous’ trends like brow care are here to stay, along with the focus on healthy and radiant skin. You can expect skincare products to remain almost some of the most popular beauty products for fall 2021.\u003cbr\u003eSome of the trends that you’ll find on this list are ones that we’ve come to know and love during fall. Picture soap brows, ultra-bold lips, and eyeshadow with an electric hue. As we start to rediscover the world again and the seasons change, you can expect makeup to become brighter and more joyful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhatever trends you decide to experiment with, make sure they’re ones that reflect your personality and help you create a makeup routine that doubles as a self-care ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eRead on to find out about the 7 fall 2021 makeup trends that we’re most excited for this season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLined Eyes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe focus on eyes that we saw during spring and summer aren’t going anywhere, in fact, it’s going to get even bolder. \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kristenstewartx/\"\u003eKristen Stewart\u003c/a\u003e’s go-to makeup artist has said that fall 2021 will be the time for heavy lined eyes. She explains that it’s because of the longer bags and ‘70s inspired hair cuts that mean you need to overdo the liner to help define the shape of your eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not all black eyeliner that you’ll be seeing though. While the debate of black vs navy blue eyeliner continues to go on in the background, other shades that you can experiment with include sable brown and deep burgundy. What we enjoy about these shades is that they give you definition and shape to your eyes, without being as harsh as black eyeliner. They add an unexpected pop of colour to the windows of your soul.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eReverse cat eye\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you find something that you love, do it in reverse. That seems to be the philosophy of the beauty industry right now. After all, we’ve already been talking about reverse makeup and contouring – which revolves around applying your makeup products in reverse order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/reverse-cat-eye-trend\"\u003e‘reverse cat eye’\u003c/a\u003e look is a little different in that it flips the silhouette upside down, meaning that your liner focuses on your lower lash line, instead of the outer corner of your eye. You can easily adapt this eyeliner look to make it as subtle or as dramatic as you like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes this eyeshadow look more seductive is when you use a fluffy brush to blend the liner under your lash line for a smoky look. If you want a more defined look, add your favourite liquid liner to the inner corner of your eyes, before applying mascara to your top and bottom lashes for a fluffy look. With the addition of liquid eyeliner and mascara, you can make your reverse eyeliner look more dramatic and striking for a bold appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat we love about the reverse cat eye makeup trend is that it’s beginner friendly and easy to recreate. You can go all out by finishing off your look with false eyelashes or keep it simple with a few coats of mascara on the top and bottom lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSkinimalism\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAfter living through a global pandemic, working from home, and the reality of mask wearing, heavy makeup looks have become a thing of the past. People want a more streamline and easy to use makeup routine that has a simpler approach. ‘Skinamlism’ focuses on embracing your natural beauty, focusing on evening your texture and creating a glowing radiance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that we know for sure is that skinimalism is here to stay – well after the pandemic and long after fall 2021. With our social calendars starting to fill up again, we’re all looking to keep our skin healthy to maintain a radiant glow. Keep your buildable conceal and contour products nearby and focus on letting your skin breathe to keep it looking radiant and healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can update your makeup for fall 2021 by adding an oil-free or lightweight foundation to help your skin transition from summer to fall. These formulas are easier to blend and will give your skin the hydration it needs to prevent flakiness and dryness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGlossy lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne trend that we’re waiting to welcome back in fall 2021 is glossy lips. During the pandemic and when mask mandates were in place, no one could show off their lipstick or glossy lips. It meant that our lip products were going unloved in our makeup bag. It’s time to make up for lost time with a glossy lip look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to find a lipgloss that has either a glossy or satin shine – whichever you prefer. Choose a hydrating formula that you can wear alone, as a topper over lipstick, or as a base to lock in moisture and hydration. If you’re not sure which lip products to use with a skinimalistic makeup look or if you’re going for a semi-matte look, glossy lips are always a great idea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLashes, lashes, and more lashes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’re already back to talking about eye makeup. It’s one trend that is going to last through the pandemic and beyond. For fall 2021, your lashes are once again taking centre stage. You want to work on getting your lashes as fluffy and voluminous as possible, with definition in the upper and lower lashes. You can invest in a regular lash lift and tint for a low-maintenance look or purchase faux lashes if you’re not able to go to a salon for a lash lift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSoapy brows\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSoapy brows are one trend that we know always associate with fall makeup. When we’re thinking about things like lash lifts and reverse cat eye looks, you’ve got to remember about your brows. While your eyes are the window to your soul, it’s your brows that frame and shape your face. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of soap brows is that they work with any makeup look and are easy to achieve. If you missed this trend when it was all the rage last summer, now is your chance to give it a go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStatement electric eyeshadows \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as we saw the fuschia pink lids and electric blue shades on the Versace fall/winter 2021 runway, we knew that dramatic electric eyeshadow colours were going to be one of the biggest trends for fall 2021.

Finish off your smoky eyeshadow look with a coat of your favourite mascara.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOver the Top Colour\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of extreme eyeshadow looks, it’s time to bring colour back into our lives. \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/helenevasnier/\"\u003eHelene Vasnier\u003c/a\u003e, the makeup artist for \u003ca href=\"https://www.giambattistavalli.com/en/\"\u003eGiambattista Valli\u003c/a\u003e, created a pansy-inspired makeup look for fashion week that was focused on a vivid two-tone look. These abstract and watercolored shades gives the eyeshadow look a beautiful effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also saw bold hues of colour at the Versace show. We fell in love with the electric cat eye liner and shades of crimson, cyan, and fuchsia. You can use saturated or swirled colours to help emphasise the contours of your face. You can carry a bold of pink over with a draped blush of bright fuchsia over your cheeks for a healthy glow. We saw this look at the Vivienne Westwood and Molly Goddard shows. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t forget. Your face is a blank canvas that you can transform with colour and pigment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePencil Thin Lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne unexpected trend that we saw on the runway was the idea of ‘pencil thin’ lips. We’re used to seeing the dramatic and oversee lips that were inspired by Kylie Jenner, but the ‘90s lip liner trend is making a comeback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt adds a subtle boost to the shape of your lips without getting too carried away. The key is to make your liner and lipstick appear to blend together for a seamless look. Start by applying your lipstick first before taking your lipliner in a slightly darker shade to avoid an obvious contrast between the shades. The general rule of thumb is to always choose shades that are within two hues either side of your lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSnow White Inspired\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith fall just around the corner, you can use Snow White as your styling muse – just like we saw on the runway. It’s a 1990s makeup trend that was largely led by \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbarrymore/\"\u003eDrew Barrymore\u003c/a\u003e. It’s ultra-fashionable and easy to create with just a few products. You want to choose the hues that work best with your undertones. If you’re someone who wears silver accessories, look out for frosted or silver shadows to add to your eyeshadow look. If you prefer gold jewellery, choose eyeshadow shades that have a yellow or golden undertone. You can go full Drew Barrymore by adding a coat of burgundy lipstick to contrast the hues of the eyeshadow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRed-Hot Lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eRed lipstick is finally back in style. We were all guilty of ditching it when we were wearing face masks. After all, no one wanted to deal with the chaos of a smudging lipstick when wearing a face mask. For fall 2021, you want to invest in a highly-pigmentated red lipstick with a creamy consistency to stand out from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe like to think of red lipstick as an instant confidence booster. It’s like stepping into your favourite designer shoes or the little black dress that hugs your curves. When you’re wearing\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-most-iconic-red-lipstick-shades\"\u003e red lipstick\u003c/a\u003e, everything changes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can finish off your makeup look by focusing on creating a dewy, luminous glow for your skin and adding a thin eyeliner to keep the attention on your lips. If you’ve mastered the art of skinimalism, you can even go makeup-free and focus on your lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve seen red lipstick being reimagined in several ways this season. On the runway, models appeared with highly pigmented crimson lips, while others choose to go with brick red lipstick with a clear gloss for an ultra-glam finish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re worried about your red lipstick smudging, it’s a good idea to try and keep it soft with your finish. After all, red lipstick will always smudge. Other runway shows like Vivienne Westwood and Ferragamo went outside the box by using gold and silver liner for their red lipstick. Over at Nina Ricci, they decided to incorporate an oil-finish to their lips with a metallic shine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSoft Monochrome\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re using fall 2021 as an opportunity to get back into the world of makeup, try soft monochrome looks – otherwise known as ‘soft glam’.

Cream and liquid products are your best friend when creating the ‘soft glam’ look. Make sure to add a shine to your lips, cheekbones, and eyelids. Lipgloss is perfect for adding a healthy finish to your look. Instead of wearing black eyeliner, swap it out for a more understated hue like chocolate-brown or chestnut.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e90s and Y2K Beauty\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re a fan of TikTok beauty trends, you’ll be familiar with the ‘90s and Y2K looks that are popping up everywhere right now. Celebrities are no stranger to these two aesthetics. Bella Hadid is the poster girl for ‘90s makeup. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‘90s makeup is all about nude lipstick and a dark lip liner. Keep your brows groomed and on the thinner side, while opening your eyes with a smoky wing.

We saw this aesthetic appearing on the Erdem and Christian Dior shows on the runway. The secret to creating this look at home is to practice and be patient. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFocus on drawing the graphic shape with a grey or brown pencil before adding over a pigment-heavy eyeliner to give it a smoky finish. One thing you want to do is keep a cotton swab nearby to help clean up any mess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can make this celebrity-approved beauty trend more wearable with a simple nude lipstick or a clear gloss. While we love avant-garde makeup trends, you want to make sure you balance it out with a flawless base and don’t go too OTT with each part of your makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFall 2021 is an opportunity to have some fun with your makeup and fall back in love with your beauty routine. \u0026nbsp;These celebrity-approved beauty trends are the perfect way to shake up your look for the season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these celebrity approved makeup looks are your favourite?

Most of the hacks you’ll find on \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\"\u003eTikTok \u003c/a\u003efollow the DIY format that often goes viral on the platform.

Jumping into a TikTok hack without researching first, could cause your skin serious consequences. We’re taking a deep-dive into the world of TikTok beauty hacks to see which ones are worth trying and which ones you should definitely skip when they appear on your ‘for you’ page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSlugging \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e(Must-Try – Unless you have acne-prone skin)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest beauty hacks on TikTok is also one that we think everyone should try. Slugging is a hack that involves using a thick moisturizer (or Vaseline) on your face, applying a thick coat, and leaving it on as an overnight treatment. The purpose of this hack is to hydrate your skin, making it no surprise that this trend started in South Korea. K-beauty is all about achieving a dewy glow for your skin, with this hack being an easy way to jump on the k-beauty bandwagon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you give slugging a go?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis hack works as it helps to lock-in moisture for your skin, repairing damage to your skin’s natural protective barrier. The easiest way to try the slugging trend is to cleanse and moisturize your skin before you give the hack a try. However, you want to avoid doing this hack after using a retinol or exfoliating acid, as it can irritate your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSlugging is a beauty hack that you want to use occasionally to address seasonal dryness or flaking in your skin. If you start using it too regularly, you’re almost guaranteed to start suffering breakouts. If you suffer from acne breakouts, you want to avoid slugging as it will clog up your pores and lead to more breakouts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eContouring with sunscreen\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e (Avoid at all costs)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe all know\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-everyday-sun-care-routine\"\u003e the importance of using sunscreen\u003c/a\u003e, but TikTok has taken it to the next level with this beauty hack. Sunscreen contouring focuses on using sunscreen on specific places of your face, creating a tanning effect on certain areas of your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eUnlike slugging, this is one TikTok beauty hack that you want to avoid at all costs. You should be applying sunscreen all over your face, instead of picking and choosing. It can be dangerous to your skin and cause lasting damage that leads to premature aging. If your skin is unprotected, it could even lead to skin cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you really want to try this TikTok hack, there is a way of doing it that is safer. You could use a lower SPF – like an SPF30 – as your base before using a stronger SPF for the contouring effect. While this isn’t dermatologist approved, it’s less harmful than the original trend.\u003cbr\u003eWhatever you’re doing, make sure you’re wearing at least SPF30 on your skin and reapplying every few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShaving with sandpaper\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e (Avoid, avoid, avoid!)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother TikTok beauty trend that you want to avoid at all costs is sandpaper shaving. This peculiar trend could only go viral on a platform like TikTok. While using sandpaper will remove hair, it will take your skin along with it. If you start trying this trend at home, you can expect to see scarring on your skin and hyperpigmentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere’s no reason to use sandpaper for removing body hair. Traditional shaving and using wax are significantly safer for your skin, along with gently exfoliating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis TikTok trend is one that we definitely advise avoiding – no matter what!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDrinking Chlorophyll \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e(Skip)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne TikTok beauty trend that everyone is talking about is drinking chlorophyll. You’ll find dozens of videos that talk about its wellness benefits, including improving your skin and diminishing acne. The bold claims behind this hack include that it can boost your energy, improve body odour, and reduce bad breath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Chlorophyll? It’s a pigment that you can find in plants and that plays a role in the photosynthesis process. The hack focuses on the antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins that power Chlorophyll. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile Chlorophyll has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, it’s not as amazing as the TikTok hype would have you believe. There are only a limited number of studies that suggest that chlorophyllin is suitable for treating acne – and all of these have involved applying it topically. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDrinking chlorophyllin has not been proven to have any benefits. While it is considered to be a relatively safe substance, you carry the risk of developing ‘pseudoporphyria’, a phototoxic rash that can form after drinking liquid chlorophyll. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInstead of drinking chlorophyll, there’s an easier life hack that you could try.

This treatment uses a dermaroller to lightly prick the skin using tiny needles. The purpose of this treatment is to rejuvenate your skin by boosting your collagen production to give your skin a smoothing effect, while firming and toning your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMost people choose to go to a trained professional for their microneedling treatment, but TikTokers have taken the treatment into their own hands – not always with the best results. While microneedling may seem like a straightforward treatment, it’s not one that you should be doing yourself. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMicroneedling produces little holes in your skin, which open up your pores and allow everything from bacteria and allergens to enter your skin. If your microneedling device isn’t clean, it can lead to infections and breakouts that can cause chaos for your skin.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to try microneedling, book in for a professional treatment instead of trying to DIY it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eReverse Makeup \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e(Try it ASAP!)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMost of the beauty hacks on this list have been pretty extreme and ones that you to avoid. Some of the best TikTok beauty hacks are the ones that are the simplest and easiest to do. Reverse makeup is an easy to try hack that focuses on changing up the order that you do your makeup routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe idea behind this trend is that you put your makeup on by starting with your eyes, instead of your base. By doing your brows and eyes first, you’re able to define your makeup and accentuate your features before moving on to the base. When you do your makeup in reverse, you’ll likely find that you end up using less concealer and foundation that normal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBobby pin eyeliner\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e(Tried and Tested!)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother easy TikTok beauty trend is to use a bobby pin to achieve the perfect winged eyeliner look. Eyeliner is one step of our makeup routine that most of us struggle with. Unless you’ve got a steady hand, it can be difficult to achieve that illustrious winged liner look. \u003cbr\u003eTikTok is full of dozens of different eyeliner hacks, but the bobby pin one is perhaps the easiest. All you need is to coat the flared end of your bobby pin with eyeliner and apply it against the corner of your eyelid. If you have hooded eyes, this TikTok beauty hack will be right up your street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCurling your hair with socks \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e(One of our favourites!)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe all know the damage that hot tools can cause to our hair. Did you know that socks are an easy way of achieving bouncy curls without damaging your hair? All you need is four long socks to twist into different sections of your hair, before securing them with one or two hair ties. You can sleep in them overnight to help the curls form around the socks before removing them in the morning and brushing them out.\u003cbr\u003eUsing socks is an easy alternative to a curling wand and means that you don’t have to worry about damaging your hair. The main drawback of this TikTok beauty hack is the time commitment. You won’t be able to achieve a curl instantly like with a curling wand. While this TikTok hack can be useful, it’s not a reason to throw your curling iron away just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these TikTok beauty trends are your favourite?

The runway. Yes, it’s usually where you’ll find next season’s fashion must-haves, but the makeup that the models wear is just as telling. Brands put just as much thought into their chosen makeup looks as the models and sets that they choose. Neon makeup is once again making an appearance on the runway of some of the world’s fashion capitals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Autumn/Winter 2021 show for Off-White was one of the first shows to put neon makeup at the front of its look. The fashion house created their neon makeup looks by using crayons in blue and neoprene orange shades, reflecting the colours that Virgil Abloh had used as the centre piece of the Off-White collection. The neon makeup looks were created by makeup artist Morgane Martini, who came up with the graphic neon eye makeup looks that reflected the aesthetic of the collection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe Off-White collection was named ‘Laboratory of Fun’, which gave Martini the idea of using Virgil’s keen eye to create colourful neon makeup looks. Neon was chosen as the focal point for the makeup looks as it instantly brings your attention to the person’s face, in particular their eyes. Virgil and Martini used neon as a form of self-expression for each individual person – regardless of their age and personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile neon makeup is all over the runway, it’s slowly starting to make its way onto our social media feeds and into \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-biggest-beauty-trends-that-you-need-to-try\"\u003emainstream beauty trends\u003c/a\u003e.

Trust us. There’s a reason why we don’t wear them every day. Our number one piece of advice is to start small and that less is more. You don’t need to go crazy with your neon makeup or think too far out of the box. Start small and work your way up until you become more comfortable with using neon shades. You don’t need to use just neon shades either. You can use these colours to add little details or a pop of colour to your look, such as at your inner corner. You can add a coat of eyeliner or blend in a neon shade. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSometimes it’s the smallest things that can have the biggest impact. Keep it simple when you get started and find ways to incorporate hints of neon into any makeup look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou don’t need to go all out to jump on this trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAdd a graphic twist\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest trends within the neon beauty niche is graphic elements. It’s an easy way to take a trend that’s synonymous with the ‘80s and to give it a modern and contemporary twist. Adding a graphic twist makes your makeup feel more like living art or an accessory than just a beauty trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like our first tip, you don’t need to go over the top with graphic makeup. It’s all about letting your creativity flow and trying something new. Graphic eye makeup is one of the must-try trends within the beauty industry. Adding a neon colour palette can give your look an edge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of graphic is that anyone can give it a go. You don’t need to be a professional makeup artist to start experimenting with graphic eyeliner. One of the easiest ways to create this look is by using a tape to help you achieve a straight line – whatever shape you’re trying to create. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMake sure that you place the tape down correctly before going over it with an eyeliner pen or pencil to create the shape you need. You don’t need to be an artist to achieve the shape that you want. It’s an easy way to add a flair of creativity to your makeup look. Keep your graphic lines small if you want a subtle look or go all out for something bold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eGraphic eye makeup is a way of enhancing your features and changing your everyday makeup look without doing too much. If you want to keep it understated, use a neutral shade as your base to help the neon hues to pop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStay away from your lash line\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s easy to get carried away when you’re doing neon makeup. You’ll want to keep a micellar water or makeup wipes on hand to clean up any mistakes or if you get a little too carried away. One area that you want to stay away from is the lash line when doing neon makeup. Unless you’re planning on heading out for a night on the town, you want to keep your lash line and lashes as natural as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eCurl your lashes and add a coat of your go-to mascara but stay away from adding a neon shade to your lash line. If you drop any of neon colour into your lash line, you can take a cotton bud with micellar water to help clear up any mistakes that might form. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to experiment with your lash line on the right occasion though. It can be an easy way to take your makeup routine to the next level, whether it’s with a blue mascara or adding a neon eyeliner to your lash line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKeep your colours minimalistic\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNeon is a bold statement for any occasion – especially when you’re using it with makeup. Unless you’re heading to Coachella, you want to be subtle and minimal with the colours that you choose. While colour contrasting is a growing trend, you want to choose neon shades that complement each other and work well together. It’s usually best to choose one or two neon shades to start with and to choose buildable colours instead of jumping off at the deep end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the best ways to select colours is to keep it monochromatic, especially if you’re incorporating other trends like graphic lines. You want to make sure your colours work well together if you’re going outside of the monochromatic look. Unexpected shades like blue and warm orange can work perfectly well together – especially if you keep it simplistic. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, it’s the simplest looks that have the greatest impact. If you use too much neon, it can make your eyeshadow look like you’re heading to an ‘80s-themed disco party. You don’t have to wear every neon shade in your eyeshadow palette to have a big impact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKeep the rest of your look natural\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe secret to pulling off a dramatic makeup look like neon eyeshadow is to balance out the rest of your makeup. This trick is one that we’re always talking about. If you want to make one part of your makeup ‘pop’, you want to keep the rest of it minimalistic. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLet your eyeshadow take centre stage with a clean and simplistic base look. The Off-White runway look didn’t include any blush or contour, but you can add these if you wish. You want to focus on creating a flawless base to help your eye makeup pop. It’s usually best to choose a ‘your lips but better’ lipstick shade and incorporate soft contouring into your makeup look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNeon makeup shouldn’t be scary. With these five tips, it couldn’t be easier to experiment with this beauty trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of neon eye makeup looks?

If you’re experimenting with blush for the first time, this is the application method that you want to start with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to start by taking your blush colour and swirling your brush into the powder before applying a small dab of it onto the apples of your cheeks. You can use your brush to buff it out onto your cheeks in circular motions for the most natural look. Applying it to the apples of your cheeks helps to give the illusion of a wider (and thinner) face, while also brightening your complexion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAre you not sure where exactly to place your blush? One useful tip is to put your blush two fingers away from your nose and two fingers under the bottom of your eye.

It’s the perfect way to get out of your comfort zone. It’s one beauty trend that we’ve been seeing all over the runway. Draping is often thought of as a ‘side-eye’ blush as it is a softer and fluffier application that uses a small to medium size blush. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe easiest way to achieve the draping look is to add the blush to your temples before draping it downwards across your cheekbones to help frame your face. Shades of rose and coral are the best choices for this draping look. You can also sweep the colour from your cheekbones and up into your hairline, working it across your brow area. This style of application helps to naturally brighten your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to experiment with draping, there is nothing more important than remember to blend it properly. You might decide to use two or three different shades to create a softer look, keeping them all within the same colour family. You can focus the bolder shade around your temple and the high points of your cheekbones, while keeping the softer shades to your hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eStart with the deeper shade at your eye socket and blend it towards your temple and cheekbones using a denser blush brush and by working in circular motions. You can use a fluffier brush with a second colour to create that seamless draping look and to add warmth to your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe sun-kissed and natural glow look\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne reason why everyone loves blush is that it’s an easy way to give your skin a \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/how-to-look-sun-kissed-all-year-round\"\u003esun-kissed\u003c/a\u003e look and an all over glow.

Start with using your bronzer as a base layer, helping to dull the pigment of your blush so that it doesn’t look too harsh or artificial. You want to use the bronzer to create a dewy glow, before adding your blush. You want to sweep your blush over the parts of your face where the sun would naturally hit, including the top of the bridge of your nose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t forget to add some colour to the rest of your face, including your chin, eyelids and foreheads. When you’re aiming for a sun-kissed look, you want to try and keep it as realistic as possible. You don’t want to make it look as though you’re wearing makeup, but instead as though you’ve spent a day sitting out in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can add a twist to the look by starting with a dewy foundation for a natural glow before using a freckle pen to create some faux freckles for a sun-kissed look. You can add extra dimension to your face by using two different shades of blush – one brighter colour and then a softer hue within the same family for added dimension. Take a stippling brush to add the darker shade to the high points of your face, before using the softer hue on your cheeks, chin, and nose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA natural flush with a low and intense colour\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMost of us want to avoid making our face looked flushed. Whether it’s from being outside in the wind or taking a jog, we usually avoid the activities that add a little colour to our cheeks. Using a blush to add a flush of colour to your cheek can be cute and right on trend. \u003cbr\u003eFor the most natural look, keep an eye out for blushes with a cream or gel-based formula. Pink and rosy hues will give you a more natural finish and prevent adding too much texture to your skin. You want to focus the placement of your blush on the higher parts of your cheeks to avoid any harsh lines on your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any leftover blush on your fingers or brush, you can apply them lightly to the top of your nose. This placement gives you a more realistic look, which is what you want to aim for with this aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAn easy way to blend this colour is by using a makeup sponge to help apply the colour across the apples of your cheeks. You want to smile when applying the colour, working from the centre of your cheeks. Less is more when it comes to blush and it’s best to start small and build the colour slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re applying blush to nose, focus it on the sides of the bridge of your nose for a naturally flushed looked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSculpted blush across your cheekbones\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eContouring isn’t the only way to add definition to your face – blush is the perfect alternative if you want a more natural look. If you want to achieve a sculpted look using blush, you need to buff it into your cheekbones using a brush. You’ll place the blush in a similar place to where you would put highlighter, applying it with small circular strokes while blending it upwards and outworks as you move.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can use this sculpting method to help naturally lift your face by patting in the powder using an upward motion. You can start in the mid-section of your cheekbones and work diagonally upwards towards the corner of your eyes. If you want a seamless look, bring the blush under your eyes but you don’t want to take it as far as your hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAn angled blush brush is another option that you can use, gliding it across your cheekbones and working it inward before buffing any leftover product into your temples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBlush is one of our favourite beauty products and one that is coming back in style thanks to the resurgence of natural makeup.

Gone are the days when we would spend an hour in front of a mirror applying our makeup products as part of a 20-step routine. Natural beauty is back in vogue, and we want to keep our makeup routines short and simple. Hybrid formulas are everywhere we look as people reach for multitasking products that allow us to cut down and streamline our daily routine.\u003cbr\u003eAfter a year of wearing little to no makeup, it’s no surprise that we’re in no rush to go back to the days of layers upon layers of makeup. Along with trends like soft sculpting, hybrid lipstick formulas are becoming one of the ‘it’ trends within the beauty industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/this-is-how-to-flawlessly-apply-your-lipstick\"\u003e lipstick\u003c/a\u003e is that it can take a minimal makeup look and change how it looks instantly. You can take a 5-minute beauty routine and make it look like you’ve spent all morning working on your makeup. Have you ever added a touch of red lipstick and seen your look go from a 6 to a 10? Adding a bold lipstick instantly makes it look like you’ve put more effort into your makeup look than you actually did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking for ways to streamline your skincare routine, you want to look for lipstick products that give you the best of both worlds. You don’t want to compromise on colour, but you want a formula that hydrates your lips as well. Some of the most popular hybrid formulas are also the ones that are most beneficial to your lips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eTinted lip oils and balms will give you a wash of colour while giving your lips the hydration and nourishment that it needs. The skincare benefits within these products help improve the longevity of your lipstick colour for longer wear. Applying a densely pigmented lipstick, such as a liquid lipstick, can be difficult and lead to mistakes. If you want a quick makeup routine, oils and balms are easy to apply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re not a fan of applying dark lipstick that you can overapply and make mistakes with, then oils and balms are the perfect alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t forget about using a gloss\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the Y2K aesthetic, we’ve all fallen back in love with using a lip gloss. For years, we all skipped this lip product as the formulas were sticky and would end up causing your hair to stick to your lips. Gloss is an easy way to switch up the texture of your lips to suit your mood or the occasion. If you’re looking to achieve a dewy look, gloss is one product that you don’t want to overlook. It’s a must-have for your makeup bag that you can use a dozen different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can apply a lip gloss as a stand-alone product or layer it with other lip products for a more dramatic look. If you want to add extra texture, start by using a long-lasting lip product like a stain before swiping on a gloss. You can choose one that is clear to create a natural shine and iridescence or find a gloss that matches the lipstick shade to amplify the colour. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to keep your base colour in place all day long, you’ll need to use a lip liner as a primer to help maintain the colour. A liner is ideal as it helps to create a base that your lipstick pigment can stick to for added longevity. One type of lip liner that you want to look out for is those with a gel-based formula. These are waterproof and long-lasting, staying in place throughout the day and into the evening. Whether you’re drinking coffee or out in the sun, you want to make sure your gloss has a proper base for the best results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGo bold with your colour but stay foolproof\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAfter so long without wearing lipstick, it’s easy to feel like you have to keep it safe with a neutral or nude shade. Sometimes, the best way to get back onto the bandwagon is to go off the deep end. Instead of playing it safe, choose a bold lipstick colour instead. You want to find a colour that is both bold and fool-proof, which will depend on your application skills when it comes to using different lip products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBright and bold shades will help to naturally warm up your skin and brighten your complexion, especially during the summer and holiday months. The one thing to keep in mind with using a bold lipstick colour is that these more intense pigments are more likely to smudge than their natural counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re trying to get back into wearing lipstick for the first time since the pandemic, you want to make it as easy as possible. The best way to do this is to find a bold shade that works for you and has a fool proof application. You want to find a long-lasting lipstick that won’t smudge and that you can feel comfortable wearing and reapplying throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eKeep an eye out for lipstick products that have long-lasting formulas and don’t forget about the importance of layer lip products to improve their longevity. Throughout the day, your lipstick products will naturally start to wear off as you eat, drink, and speak. The best way to prevent this is by applying thin layers of products – starting with your lip balm and going through to your liner, lipstick, and gloss. You want to keep these layers thin to prevent them blotching. As your lipstick starts to naturally wear off, these thin layers will come off seamlessly together in a more flattering way as the colour dies down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou also want to consider which lipstick colours work best for your skin tone and complexion. While everyone can wear a red lipstick, there are different shades and hues within this colour that better complement one skin tone over the other. Don’t be afraid to experiment with corals, pinks, reds, and oranges as you rediscover the joys of lipstick colours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLet your lipstick take centre stage with a subtle and glamorous look.

Nothing makes your smile look brighter and more dazzling than a coat of lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to get the most of out your smile, use a blue-based lipstick shade that helps whiten your teeth and reduce any yellow and orange tones in your skin. One thing you want to keep in mind – whatever shade you choose – is to make sure you don’t have lipstick on your teeth. Nothing can ruin your smile quicker than lipstick on your teeth. You want to blot your lip after applying your products, before running a finger between your lips and teeth to remove any excess products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre you starting to wear lipstick again?

This hairstyle works with your natural wave and textures, bringing them to light in a way that you wouldn’t find with a longer or heavier haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStyle inspiration for your wolf haircut\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith a new hairstyle like the wolf cut, it’s easy to assume that there’s only a few people that you can use as your style muse. The popularity of the wolf haircut means that it’s already forming a loyal celebrity following – including everyone from FKA Twigs to Demi Lovato and Billie Eilish to name just a three. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’re obsessed with Billie Eilish’s new bleached blonde take on the style, which has taken centre stage for the promotion of her new ‘Happier Than Ever’ world tour and album release. Her bleach blonde colour choice shows how you can take the trend and give it a \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-y2k-hair-and-makeup-trends-that-everyone-is-talking-about\"\u003eY2K \u003c/a\u003etwist.\u003cbr\u003eEvery time we open our TikTok or Instagram apps, there are countless girls rocking this cool and edgy hairstyle that requires minimal styling and upkeep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother celebrity that you can use as your styling muse is Debby Ryan. She’s taken the mullet style and given it a more laidback look by adding a layered fringe that extends down to her ear. This badass haircut has a gender-fluid feel to it and is ideal for those who want to frame their face while still rocking the trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne reason why people love this haircut is that it’s easy to maintain. You don’t need to wash your hair more than once a week, as your hair’s natural oils add a gritty appearance to your bangs and the edge of your hair. By skipping a fee washes, you can use your hair’s natural oils as a way of adding texture to your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOnly washing your hair once a week doesn’t mean that it needs to have a ‘dirty’ texture. You can achieve the gritty look without being too dirty with just a few products that you probably already have in your cosmetic bag. Dry shampoo is your BFF for this hairstyle, along with a matte pomade to help \u0026nbsp;add a natural shine to your hair and keep the style in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf your hair is naturally dry, you want to use a shiny pomade or choose a lightweight oil to apply to your bangs and the side of your hair to give you the grunge look that everyone loves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to pull off the wolf haircut\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that the wolf haircut is one that everyone can rock, but you do want to consider your hair type and face shape before you commit to the hairstyle. Like any radical change, it’s a good idea to speak to your hairdresser before you take the plunge. You should consider your hair’s natural texture, as this hairstyle tends to look better on those who can maintain a dirtier look. If you’re someone who is in a routine of washing and drying their hair every day, this haircut might not be for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe other thing that you want to consider is how this haircut exposes your face shape. You can describe the wolf haircut as ‘lifting the veil off your face’ as it leaves your nothing to hide behind as your hair is pushed back to your ears. If you want to hide a little of your face, you can add in a curtain bang or a micro fringe to frame your face. If you opt for a fringe, you’ll have to consider the practicalities of growing it out. It’s best to speak to your hairdresser to form a sold game plan, whether it’s regular appointments or slowing trimming the bottom of your hair to encourage growth.\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing you want to consider is that your hair type might leave the style looking flat on you if you’re not commit to daily styling. While it is a more low-maintenance style, this will depend on the texture and feel of your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile you’ll see most people rocking the wolf haircut with straight and sleek hair, it doesn’t mean you have to follow the same aesthetic. Curly hair can give the wolf haircut a more feminine twist. If you’re aiming for this look, craft your curls by stacking them towards the top of your head for extra volume before trimming them downwards to achieve the shaggy wolf haircut look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can also experiment with the wolf haircut without losing the length of your hair. It’s easy to think that the only way to jump on this trend is by chopping off your locks to a blob length. This twist on the trend is one that you definitely want to see a hairstylist to achieve. It’s on the wilder side but is the most unique style. It’s all about focusing on the shaggy layers at the top of your hair that are synonymous with the trend, tapering them towards the bottom of your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’re official obsessed with the wolf haircut style and can’t wait to see where the trend goes next. If you’re looking to shakeup your hairstyle but can’t decide between a mullet or a shaggy bob, this is the style for you. It’s a daring look that is sure to make a statement wherever you go. While this look is typically low maintenance, you want to consider your hair type and texture before committing to the style long-term. You’ll want to invest in a dry shampoo and texturized spray to give your wolf haircut a gruddy appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre you thinking of joining the wolf haircut pack?

Draping – a form of contouring that focuses on blush – is becoming one of the biggest trends of the season. Pinks are one hue that you want to fill your makeup bag with during the summer. Pinks and red also work with blue if you want a pop of colour. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor this summer trend, it’s all about creating a grading effect using different hues of blue, pink, and purple. Your eyes are the perfect way of experimenting with these colours. All you need is a handy blending brush and a few matte and iridescent shades. Focus on a strong hue as your base before blending in a metallic layer for an iridescent finish. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re experimenting with this dramatic eye look, keep the rest of your makeup dewy and natural. \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/how-to-wear-neon-eye-makeup-as-part-of-your-everyday-look\"\u003eEye makeup \u003c/a\u003eisn’t for everyone, and you might decide to focus on your lips instead.

It’s risen in popularity thanks to the emergence of k-beauty trends within the mainstream and as a result of mask-wearing. The days of heavier and over the top makeup are over. For years, social media has been full of images of \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/six-makeup-artists-that-everyone-is-talking-about\"\u003emakeup artists\u003c/a\u003e and influencers creating over the top looks that you wouldn’t wear in real life. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMillennials and Gen Z are the driving force behind the natural beauty trend as they prioritise skincare over beauty products. If you’re looking to jump on the natural beauty bandwagon but aren’t sure where to start, you can take a leaf from the book of Carolina Herrera Beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe brand has been promoting the idea of ‘reverse beauty’. This trend is about starting with your brows and eyes to add definition, before moving onto your base makeup. Starting in reverse order means that you’ll likely end up using less concealer and base products than you usually would, giving you a more natural look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eReverse beauty routines means that you can have a lighter base that gives you a youthful look, allowing you to play up your eyes and lips. Keep your look natural with curled lashes, a vibrant lipstick, and groomed brows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eNatural skin finish\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith the trends shifting towards a more natural look, you want to avoid adding texture to your skin. The finish of your skin is what can make you have a ‘dewy glow’ or a greasy finish. This trend is one that will never go out of style. The secret to creating a natural skin finish is to use only as much foundation as you need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s tempting to think that you need to apply foundation all over your face and to choose a full-coverage foundation. Gucci’s beauty campaign focuses on using foundation where it’s needed, allowing your skin to shine through. You can illuminate your skin with a hint of natural gloss on your lips. If you want to try something different, add the gloss to your eyelids instead of a traditional eyeshadow. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to make sure you keep your skin looking naturally shiny than greasy. Your lips are another way to incorporate this trend. Look out for lip products in natural shades of peach, burnt orange, and light rose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t be afraid to be playful\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAfter a year of wearing little to no makeup, it’s time to start taking risks. Don’t be afraid to play with your makeup and experiment. If it doesn’t work, just wipe it off and you can start again. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eColour clashing is one of the biggest trends for summer beauty. Take your favourite colours and experiment with them. You can take a bright red lipstick and clash it with a lavender eyeshadow. If you’re looking to experiment with colour clashing, keep your base as light and natural as possible. Wearing a heavier base can make your makeup look as though it’s straight from the ‘80s – and not in a good way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFocus on one aspect of your makeup and keep the rest of your colours soft. You might experiment with a bold blue eyeliner but keep a peachy cheek and lip to balance out your look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDewy and glowing skin\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’ve already touched on it before, but dewy skin deserves it own mention on this list. Glowing skin is one of the biggest trends that come back every summer. Keep your heavy powders away for the winter months and choose products that have a cream or liquid formula instead. Avoid contouring too heavily and work with a light hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can try the new trend of soft sculpting and add in a pop of colour to achieve the dewy skin look. Look for lip products that create a stained effect or add a gloss on top of your favourite lipstick. You can also experiment with eyeshadow colours with different finishes, whether it’s a shimmer or metallic. Keep your makeup fun throughout the summer and don’t be afraid to try something new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAdd a touch of green\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile pinks and reds are common shades that we reach for during the summer, don’t overlook other trending colours. Green is one shade that we’re seeing everywhere. While you might not want to wear a green lipstick or eyeshadow, you can incorporate the shade using scaffold liner. All you need is a green eyeliner and a neutral shade, working with parallel lines. Wing your eyeliner and keep the second line above the first to create a contrast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMakeup isn’t a tattoo. If you’re not sure where to start, go bold but keep it minimalistic. You don’t need to use complicated shading or aim for a gradient effect. Sometimes the best looks are the simplest ones. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you experiment with green and aren’t happy with it, just start again.

During the summer, it’s more important than ever to focus on your skin. Don’t forget about the importance of using sunscreen to protect your skin and protect premature aging. Before you pick up your makeup products, start with your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSome of the best products for creating a dewy glow are serums that hydrate your skin to give you a natural glow. If you want to create the look of a sunkissed glow, focus on using hybrid products like a tinted moisturiser that is one shade darker than your natural colour. Your skin will stay hydrated and you’ll look like you’ve just been on holiday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOnce you’ve finished your base, take a light bronzer and apply it to the parts of your face that the sun naturally hits. You won’t be contouring your skin, but instead highlighting with a darker shade. It will give the appearance that you’ve spent a little time in the sun. Another alternative to the traditional contour is to use an orange blush to warm up your face, while keeping your makeup looking natural.\u003cbr\u003eLook out for tinted balms and creams that will hydrate your skin while adding colour. Balms naturally reflect the light and add a shine to your skin, whether you use them on your lips or cheeks. You want to fill your makeup bag with hybrid skincare products that are packed full of hydrating skincare ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich beauty trends are you loving for summer 2021?

We first swathe signs of cardigans making a return at the Autumn Winter 2019 fashion shows, when designers of all niches stated to incorporate cardigans with different cuts and colours. Chanel chose heavier cardigans, while Erdem kept their cardigans lady-like with a button-up silhouette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time Spring/Summer 2020 rolled around, cardigans were everywhere we looked- and not in the traditional style.

Whether you like the oversized look of Taylor Switch or prefer to keep it contemporary like Katie Holmes, the humble cardigan has evolved into one of the most versatile pieces that you can add to your closet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of the cardigan is that it’s one of the most size-inclusive accessories that you can add to your closet.

The secret to pulling off your cardigan is all about how you style it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons why the cardigan is making such a comeback is part of the\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-y2k-hair-and-makeup-trends-that-everyone-is-talking-about\"\u003e Y2K aesthetic\u003c/a\u003e, which draws on the nostalgia of the late-90s and early 2000s. It’s this aesthetic that led to the reappear of cardigans in the AW19 and SS20 collections. It’s a nonchalance and easy to wear piece that is unstructured, putting you in control of how it looks. Cardigans are lowkey but chic. After all, Katie Holmes’ infamous cardigan set was understated but make such an impression that it went viral overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother reason why cardigans have suddenly made a reappearance is during the pandemic. We all turned to living in athleisure, prioritising comfort over everything else when it came to choosing clothing to wear while sheltering in place. This shift in attention to comfortable pieces has remained throughout the pandemic and continues to influence trends. Just look at how we’ve swapped out heels for sneakers and loafers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough cardigans can be a comfortable essential that you reach for every day, they’re also easy to dress up and have fun with. They’re a staple that gives your look a vintage finish, making it perfect for pairing with a pleated skirt and a pair of preloved loafers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy not take a leaf from the look of Harry Style and Kurt Cobain and choose an oversized cardigan? You can use them as your fashion muse and pair your oversized cardigan with slacks, a graphic t-shirt, and loose denim trousers. These different outfit ideas show how versatile the humble cardigan is. Whatever event you have in your social calendar, a cardigan is almost guaranteed to be a staple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of a cardigan is that they’re easy to dress up or down, whether you’re wearing them with jeans or dressing them up by draping them over your shoulder with an evening dress. It’s the perfect alternative to a blazer and can still give you a tailored look while keeping it softer look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne concern – understandably – that people have when trying to style a cardigan is avoiding looking like their grandmother. The best way to keep your outfit looking young is to be unexpected with your styling. Instead of wearing a blouse, swap it out for a t-shirt. Don’t be afraid to mix masculine and feminine pieces together to create a unique look that is out of the box and reflects your personality. Whether it’s a maxi dress with combat boots or jeans and a band t-shirt, there is a dozen different ways to style your cardigan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne styling trick that you don’t want to overlook is to avoid layering your cardigan with anything that has too high a neckline or that has a thicker material. Most of the cardigans that you’ll find on the market today are made using a lighter fabric, embracing the new idea of knitwear. Keep your layers lightweight and thin, whether it’s with a t-shirt or multiple layers to stay warm against the cold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe future of the cardigan trend\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne thing we can be sure about is that cardigans are not going anywhere anytime soon. If you’re on the fence about adding a cardigan to your closet, now is the time to do so. Net-A-Porter, one of the most popular fashion e-commerce stores, has seen a 22% increase in cardigan sales in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s clear that this staple is here for at least the next few seasons. With summer in full swing, it’s the perfect time to look for a lightweight cardigan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to stay ahead of the trends, lookout for a cardigan twinset that is right in style with a ‘90s look. While the cardigan and skirt twinset aren’t for everyone, it’s the perfect way to take the Blair Waldorf look and make it contemporary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of the cardigan trend?

August is the definition of a ‘transitional’ month, meaning you’ll find yourself pulling from both the summer and autumn sections of your closet to create fashion looks. By this stage in the summer, we’re all tired of repeating the same six outfits every week. August is your last chance to get the most out of your summer closet, while letting you have the first chance to start experimenting with autumn essentials.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s time to wear your favourite floral dress, grab a staple accessory, and throw on the slingback shoes you’ve been saving for a special occasion. By the time October rolls around, you don’t want to be regretting not making the most out of August when you had it. While we never know what the weather will be like in August, we’ve been busy rounding up some of our favourite fashion looks. It might be a heatwave one day and a storm the next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMaxi dresses all month long\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile we believe that maxi dresses are a year round staple, they become an essential that we all live in during the summer. Don’t be afraid to get the most out of your maxi dress during the final weeks of August. The beauty of a maxi dress is how easy they are to style. You can dress it up with stilettoes or keep it casual with on-trend dad sandals for a laidback look. If your maxi dress is sleeveless, then you want to grab a cardigan or some light knitwear to throw over your shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother dress that you want to experiment with in August is a ‘trent’ dress. With Coachella and most music festivals being cancelled, August is the last chance the most of us have to channel the bohemian chic of a maxi tent dress. Add a classic slingback heel for an elevated look or keep it more casual with leather sandals. We’ve already confessed our love for maxi dresses and summer is the perfect time to get the most out of wearing a massive maxi dress. If you want to make it more ladylike, add a top handle bag and some oversized sunglasses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExperiment with darker hues\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne thing to consider when it comes to the month of August is that the leaves are already starting to change. While the temperatures are still high, you can start to add darker hues to your every look. Don’t be afraid to swap out your summer pastel shades for deeper hues to add a touch of autumn to your look. The perfect August outfit would be to take your favourite summer-time silhouette, like a pleated midi-skirt, and choose an on-trend shade of green with a pop of colour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSneakers with a mini dress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’ve all converted to living in our sneakers, whether it’s with athleisure or a maxi dress. When it comes to dresses, we’ve mainly been styling longer dresses with sneakers, but August is the perfect time to switch it up and wearing a mini skirt with your sneakers. If you’ve been building a summer tan, this outfit is a way you can show off your glowing skin. What we love about wearing sneakers with a mini skirt or dress is that it instantly gives it a casual look. If there’s a dress you’ve been holding onto all summer and looking for an excuse to wear, you can add sneakers instead of heels to make them more wearable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThink of the outfits that professional tennis players wear on the court. You can keep it athleisure-inspired with a monochromatic colour theme or go all out with a tweed mini dress and white sneakers. If you’re not a fan of mini dress or skirts, you can swap out the garment for a flouncy romper to beat the last of the summer heat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAccessorize with a mini bag\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlfresco dining is all the rage as the world slowly starts to reopen. Our social calendars are finally starting to fill up again with everything from drinks with friends to wedding receptions and birthday brunches. August is the perfect time to treat yourself toa new mini bag to carry around your essentials. When the autumn and winter comes, we tend to need to a few more essentials with us than just our lipgloss and debit card.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re heading out to town, a mini bag is your ultimate plus-one. It should be just big enough to carry your essentials without weighing your down. You can use a mini bag as a way to add a pop of colour to your outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExperiment with a print\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAugust is in that in-between stage. Summer is coming to an end, but autumn hasn’t started yet. It’s the definition of a transitional month. If there’s one thing that unites both summer and autumn, it’s printed garments. Don’t be afraid to pull out your favourite printed staple and style it with a monochrome look. Nothing pops more than a floral or animal print against a black dress or top.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAdd volume to your look\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest trends in fashion right now is the cottagecore aesthetic. We love the puff sleeves that are synonymous with the niche, and they’ve become more wearable than ever before. We think August is the perfect time to ‘go big or go home’. Pick up a dress with a puff sleeve or go more casual with a peplum top for the same look. \u0026nbsp;The secret to adding volume to your outfit is to balance it out with a slimmer silhouette. If you’re wearing a dress, choose a slim stiletto to slim-down your look. If you’re wearing a peplum top, choose a straight-leg trouser or denim jeans to contrast with the volume of your sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMix and match prints\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you can’t mix and match prints in the summer, when can you? If you’re not sure about how to mix and match prints, keep them all in the same colour family for a more cohesive look. The prints don’t need to be an exact match and the hues can be darker or lighter than each other. Wearing different shades of blue or pink can help you get the most out of your summer closet before autumn arrives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePrepare for autumn with beige\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSome people love autumn more than summer. If this is you, it’s not too early to start wearing your autumn closet. It’s easy to think that beige is just a boring hue, but it can be an elevated staple that you can make more interesting by incorporating gold hues and an investment piece, like a leather handbag. Beige can help you get ready for autumn without turning your back on summer style. Adding gold hues through your accessories can help to give your outfit some warmth and lift the beige hue to make it appear brighter and more summer-appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExperiment with lace\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother closet staple that is making a resurgence is lace. The cottagecore aesthetic is turbo-charging the resurgence of lace, which is an elevated alternative to basic pieces like a white t-shirt or a black dress. What we love about lace is that it works for any occasion and is easy to dress up or down as a staple piece. Lace helps to add texture to your outfit, which you can contrast with a ruffle skirt or denim jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEnjoy the sun and go backless\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAugust is the last chance you’ll get to wear an open back dress to work on your summer tan. When September comes around, autumn starts to go into full swing and the temperatures drop. Whether you’re heading away on a tropical vacation or going for drinks in the pub with your friends, enjoy what is left of the sun with a backless dress. It’s also the perfect opportunity to show off your summer tan – whether it’s a classic tan or from a bottle. A backless dress is sexy and a functional way to try and beat the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKitchy shorts with a lady-like blouse\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother summer staple that you want to get the most out of in August is your shorts. If you’re heading to dinner with friends or brunch with your BFF, style your printed shorts with a lady-like blouse to find the perfect spot between a dressed up and casual look. If you’re experimenting with a print, keep your blouse minimalistic with a neutral hue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAugust is the last chance to get the most out of your summer closet. When you’re planning your outfits, don’t be afraid to keep experimenting with colour and add contrasting texture. It’s also never too early to start bringing out your autumn favourites and incorporating them into your outfits as transitional pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat outfits are you planning on wearing in August?

It’s the gold-standard ingredient that has the potential to radically transform your skin, treating everything from acne to premature aging. Whatever your skincare concerns are, retinol is one ingredient that you want to look into incorporating into your routine. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the complexity of this ingredient, what it’s for, and the best way to use it. If you’ve landed on this article, chances are that you’re considering experimenting with retinol for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe believe that the secret to a successful skincare routine is consistency and understanding what ingredients can do for your skin. We’re deep diving into the world of all things retinol to find out what this ingredient can do for you and the best ways that you can incorporate it into your skincare routine. Whether you’re a newcomer to the world of retinol or devoted to the ingredient, there will be something in this guide just for you. Read on to find out everything you need to know about retinol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is retinol?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eRetinol is a form of vitamin A and does everything that you can ever want from a skincare product – and then some. The best types of retinols are the ones that will replace almost every other product in your skincare routine. What makes retinol so unique is that it regulates your sebum production, giving you a stronger natural barrier that protects your skin and keeps it hydrated. Retinol also works as an anti-aging ingredient as it boosts your collagen production, regulating your cellular turnover to smooth your skin’s texture and keep it tight and firm to prevent sagging.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s one ingredient that you want to be consistent with using for its long-term effects. Using it as a core part of your skincare routine can help to diminish the appearance of enlarged pores, soothe pigmentation, and brighten your skin’s complexion. It also helps to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles for smother skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking to achieve flawless skin, look no further than retinol. It’s most powerful when you use it alongside your everyday skincare products, including cleanser and moisturiser. Retinol is one ingredient that can – and will – transform your skin for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe different types of retinol and what they do\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you start to shop around for retinol, you’ll notice that there is more than one kind. It’s important that you choose the right one for your skin type to achieve your desired results. There are three main types of retinol that you’ll find on the market with different potencies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eRetinoic acid is the strongest form or retinol and is only available with a prescription. You’ll usually find it in varying strengths from 0.025% and 0.1%. Retinoic acid is the strongest form or retinol and is only available with a prescription. You’ll usually find it in varying strengths from 0.025% and 0.1%. This form of retinol gives you the most dramatic results as our skin cells have retinoic acid receptors, which allows this form of retinol to get straight to work and start improving your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRetinol – in its most widely used form – is weaker than retinoic acid but stronger than retinyl palmitate. What makes it different is that retinol is first converted by enzymes in your skin, turning it into retinoic acid, which makes the solution less potent. You’ll still get the same kind of results, but it will take longer to get the same effect with retinol compared to retinoic acid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eRetinyl palmitate is the weakest form of retinol as it has to go through more pathways in your skin to be converted into retinoic acid, meaning that it loses its potency as it goes through this process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eEveryone’s skin is different, and you may find that one of these forms works better than another for your skin. They’ll all give you similar results over time, with each having their pros and cons. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eRetinoic acid will often give you faster results – due to its potency – but it comes with an increased risk of irritation, including skin purging, redness, and peeling. When you start using retinoic acid, you skin will often look worse before it gets better. It’s this process that leads most people to give up on retinoids before they start to see the benefits. If you want to start using retinoids as part of your routine, you have to be committed to being consistent with your use of the ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to start using retinol so that you don’t give up at week three\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMost people give up on using retinol by week three. The secret to being successful with your retinol is to use it slowly and take baby steps to help build up your skin’s resistance. Going off at the deep end and using too much can cause your skin to become irritated. If you use your retinol correctly, you can avoid having any kind of reaction at all. You should always start by using retinyl palmitate, the weakest form of retinol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re aiming to treat a more serious skin issue – such as deep wrinkles and pigmentation – you can look into getting retinoic acid on a prescription. Whatever type of retinol product you’re using, you want to make sure you start slowly. At the beginning, use your retinol one night a week before slowly bringing up your skin’s tolerance to the ingredient. You need to give your skin time to acclimatize to the ingredient. Using your retinol correctly at the early stage can reduce your risk of dryness or irritation that often leads to people dropping retinol from their routine early on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhich retinol products to choose to add to your routine\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith most skincare products, you want to focus on what is inside the formulation of the ingredient. The difference with retinol is that you have to look at how it’s packaged in. Just like vitamin C, retinol is an unstable ingredient that you want to be careful about how it’s packaged. The best retinol will come in airless pumps and have dark packaging to prevent it attracting light that could destabilise the formula. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou’ll often find retinol products that come in a glass bottle with a dropper. While these are not the most ideal product to use, they can be a suitable choice if you look after the bottle correctly. You want to make sure to always close the lid tightly after each use to prevent the oxygenation that can destabilize the formula of your retinol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou also want to think about how you’re storing your retinol products. Retinol is similar to perfume is the sense that it should be stored somewhere cool and away from sunlight. You want to avoid storing it in your bathroom, especially near your shower or bath. It’s a good idea to store your retinol in a cold and dark place, like a vanity drawer or cupboard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLayering retinol with other skincare products\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the difficulties that people face when using retinol for the first time is trying to work out how to use it alongside other skincare products. The main concern that people have with retinol is the potential for irritation. If you find that your skin is having a reaction to the retinol, you can layer it with a moisturizer. You don’t have to use your retinol products alone and can instead pair them with other parts of your skincare routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou don’t have to use retinol as a long-term part of your skincare routine to see results. Most dermatologists will recommend using retinol products in ‘bursts’ to target specific concerns at one time. It usually takes five weeks to start seeing results from your retinol, making it an ideal timeframe for a ‘burst’ of treatment. After those five weeks, you can move onto another active ingredient before going back to retinol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’re finishing up our guide with four tips on how to use your retinol correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e1.\tNight-time use\u003cbr\u003eYou want to focus on using retinol as a night-time treatment and avoid using it alongside other active ingredients, including acids and vitamin C. One ingredient that you can use it with is hyaluronic acid for an extra boost of hydration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e2.\tStay consistent\u003cbr\u003eThis tip is one that is worth repeating. You want to be consistent and keep using your retinol. Your skin may get worse before it gets better but it’s worth sticking to it to get the results that you want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e3.\tSun protection\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re using retinol, it’s even more important to use sunscreen and SPF to protect your skin. Most people choose to use retinol as a way of treating sun damage on their skin, so the last thing you want is to further damage your skin. Using retinol can often make your skin more vulnerable to sun damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e4.\tYear-round benefits\u003cbr\u003eIt’s a common misconception that retinol is an ingredient that you should only use from autumn to spring. Retinol won’t thin your skin’s surface, meaning that you can use it even in the height of summer. Research has shown that retinol can repair sun damage, promote collagen production, and inhibit the enzymes that break down your collagen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you think of retinol?

It’s a subculture within the fashion industry and is always evolving to meet the needs of contemporary society. Designers reinvent the idea of denim almost every season, changing it up to keep denim current and at the forefront of fashion – no matter what is happening. Just look at the different types of denim that we’ve seen on the runway for 2021. Spring/Summer collection focused on oversized fits that were designed for our post-lockdown lives, where comfort was put first. This season was also when skinny jeans were declared as being cancelled, before form-fitting denim jeans made a resurgence in the Autumn/Winter collections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the new denim rules that we’re seeing everywhere is that you don’t have to stick to classic colours. Gone are the days when jeans came in black, blue, or white. You can find everything from acid-wash jeans with crystal embellishments on the Chanel runway to white denim pieces that include black spied embellishments from Maximilian Davis. Vivienne Westwood brought back denim with a baroque painted print to give it a classic Westwood twist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to must-have denim for 2021, The Row’s wide-leg wide jeans made it to the top of our wishlist after they debuted their Autumn/Winter 2021 collection. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJeans can feel like a paradox. We find ourselves reaching for our favourite old pair of jeans, as though they’re our greatest ally, even as seasons and our bodies change. It’s hard to decide that we want to buy a new pair. Why change a good thing? While you might be devoted to your beloved denim, it’s never a bad idea to refresh your closet. Swapping out your denim for a newer style can help rejuvenate your day-to-day closet and give you a new look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis guide takes a look at the changing rules within the world of denim, helping you find the perfect jeans for you. While you want to think about trends and the ‘fashion rules’ around denim, you always want to find a style that works for you. Denim is amongst one of the most versatile fashion staples and one that you want to feel comfortable with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eGrab your credit card. It’s time to buy some new denim.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChanging denim rules and the latest trends\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDenim is one of the costliest materials to produce when you look at its environmental impact. Brands like Levi are promoting more sustainable alternatives and looking for ways to cut down their carbon and environmental footprint. There’s been a shift towards a ‘buy once, wear it forever’ mentality when it comes to denim – it’s part of the allure of this garment, just like a leather jacket. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe first fashion rule we need to cover for denim is the idea that it should be wardrobe staple that transitions through every season. You want to invest in a high-quality piece that you can wear a dozen times or more. While this might be an investment at first, it’s one that will pay off in the long run. One of the golden rules of buying denim is that it’s a personal experience – not driven by trends but rather suited on your personal style. You want to find a style that flatters your shape and works for your lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe denim cuts and trends that you need to know\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe denim style that everyone is talking about is high-rise and straight-leg jeans. This trend is elegant but effortlessly chic, working for every occasion. If you want denim that will give you the most for your investment, this is the denim style that you can wear everywhere from the office to a day in the country. Straight-leg jeans are easy to wear and perfect for an off-duty look. If you need to elevate your look, grab a blazer and swap your sneakers for stilettoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to style the latest denim trends\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDenim is one material that will last forever in your closet and it’s one of the reasons why designers have always included it in their collections. This utilitarian material is durable and lasts a lifetime, giving you a sleek and chic look that is effortlessly timeless. You can even embrace the idea of double denim by mixing and matching different investment pieces together for a minimalistic and 70s-inspired look that ticks all the styling boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhich denim colours you should be wearing right now\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLike we’ve touched on before, denim is starting to appear in more colours than ever before. If you want a look of understated elegance, experiment with deeper shades of grey or a washed-out black for a smart finish. Pale-blue hues are also making a resurgence amongst denim trends, especially amongst high-rise styles for a lighter aesthetic. You want to choose neutral tones that have an understated elegance for the ultimate minimalist look and to get the most out of your denim.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe denim brands to have on your radar\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSustainability is one of the biggest trends within the fashion industry, especially amongst denim designers. There are some brands that are taking sustainability to heart and prioritizing it in their design. The LA-brand Citizens of Humanity handcrafts their denim in their ateliers and work to reduce their water consumption and use more sustainable dyes. E.L.V Denim is another brand with a sustainability mission, focusing on a zero-waste model that uses upcycled fabrics and gives this fabric a new lease on life. \u003cbr\u003eStella McCartney is a trailblazer within the world of sustainable fashion. The British designer has released a waste-free patchwork jacket that is made using denim remnants from the brand’s previous collections to reduce waste.\u003cbr\u003eOther brands that you want to have on your radar include Valentino, which has recently collaborated with the denim brand Levi to create a collection of sartorial pieces that take the iconic Levi look and give it an Italian twist. Khaite has taken the denim look and given it a classic Manhattan makeover with a contemporary finish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe true-blue trend\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest trends within the denim niche is clean lines and a true-blue colour palette. Acid washes and distressed denim are back in vogue as a transitional staple piece that everyone needs in their closet. The barrel leg is one denim silhouette that is making a comeback. It has a high waist with a flared leg, giving you a comfortable and contemporary silhouette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLooking after indigo denim\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlthough indigo is one of the biggest trends in the world of denim, it can be tricky to look after. All you need is to give your indigo denim a little TLC to help extend its lifespan. Some people like to give their jeans the least attention possible to give them the effortlessly aged look. If you have rigid denim, you might choose to not wash it every week, although washing will help you break in your denim and make it more comfortable.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you are cleaning indigo denim, you want to wash it inside out on a cold setting. You might also decide to handwash inside to prevent the colour from fading. You can dry your jeans by leaving them flat to prevent any creasing, while also avoiding the need to use an iron.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBuilding your denim closet\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe all know that denim is a year-round staple that you can wear in the height of summer or the dead of winter. You have dozens of different weights and washes to choose from, along with different cuts and colours. You want to create a denim closet that is versatile and has longevity to it. The investment denim pieces that you buy should fit your body shape and be trans-seasonal, along with being easy to wear for any occasion.\u003cbr\u003eSome of the essential denim pieces that everyone needs includes skinny and straight-leg jeans, along with an elevated whitewash jean, and a more casual style. You will always have an occasion in your social calendar that calls for a classic black jean and it’s considered a heritage piece that every closet needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to add other denim pieces to your closet outside of jeans, including jackets and jumpsuits. You want to find denim pieces that work with your existing closet and choose quality fabrics that will last a lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDenim for wearing while working from home\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDenim might be the last thing that you think of wearing while working from home, but it’s one of our favourite pieces to reach for. It’s casual while still feeling elevated. Look out for denim that has a ‘comfort stretch’ fabric that makes it perfect for wearing while lounging on the sofa or sitting behind a computer screen. You want to add looser-fitting denim that keeps you cool, while still looking contemporary and chic.\u003cbr\u003eWe think that denim is the perfect investment piece into your closet. While there are certainly denim rules and trends, it’s all personal preference. Everyone has a pair of jeans that they reach for as their tried and tested style. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat type of denim do you love to wear?

If you want to experiment with the aesthetic without buying a whole new closet, your beauty routine is the perfect place to start. We’re looking at some of the biggest Y2K hair and beauty trends that are easy to incorporate into your beauty routine. Whatever your style is, you can make this aesthetic work for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBeauty trends for the Y2K aesthetic as easy to identify. It’s all about keeping your beauty routine light-hearted and having fun with it. Unlike modern makeup, it’s not as much about contouring or trying to have the perfect makeup look. Y2K beauty is all about experimenting with colour, details, and playing with texture. Just think of the over-the-top French manicure with crystal embellishments that every celebrity had in the early 2000s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to hair trends for the Y2K aesthetic, it’s all about the accessories. It’s time to dig around your vanity in search of the claw clips and scrunchies that you used to wear. Don’t be afraid to make a statement with accessories or trying hairstyles like mini pigtails. One part of the Y2K hair trend is colour – making as much of a statement as possible. Chunky highlights and streaks of colour are a Y2K alternative to the balayage that has become increasingly popular in recent years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re thinking of playing with colours, you can experiment with the pigment and placement of your highlights for a custom look that channels your personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor Y2K makeup, it’s all about bringing back the look of our favourite early-2000s movie stars. You want to experiment with hues of pale pink and baby blue, glossy lips, and thin brows. These trends might seem a world away from what we were wearing only a year ago, but its resurgence comes in perfect time for a post-pandemic makeover. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe focus of your Y2K makeup should be bright-white eyes, using them as the focal point of your look. It’s not just about brightening your eyes, but your lips and hair as well. Don’t be afraid to experiment with the colour contrasting that was synonymous with the early-2000s. Metallic-blue eyeshadow with a bold red lip is one look that everyone has to try at least once. Nothing screams early-2000s more than colour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy is the Y2K trend becoming popular?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re not in the loop, it can be easy to feel like the Y2K aesthetic has appeared out of nowhere. With the trauma and chaos of the last year, it’s no surprise that we’re looking to the happy days of the past for inspiration. The early-2000s were a time of fun and frivolity. We’ve seen other decades make a resurgence in fashion and beaty trends – including every decade from the ’60s to the ‘90s. There’s a long-held belief that trends work on twenty-year cycle, meaning the resurgence of the Y2K aesthetic is right on time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eGen Z and Millennials are the driving force behind the Y2K trend. The older demographic is falling into the nostalgic of their teenage years, while Gen Z are experiencing these trends for the first time. With the future looking uncertain, it’s no surprise that we’re looking to the past for our hair and beauty inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason why the Y2K aesthetic is experiencing a resurgence is due to the popularity of second-hand shopping. The younger generations are aware of the danger of fast fashion and are taking active steps to become more sustainable with their fashion choices. The internet is full of advice on how to find hidden gems at thrift stores, with Gen Z sharing their finds on Instagram and TikTok. Pre-loved shopping platforms like Depop and Vestiaire Collective are becoming just as popular as other mainstream platforms selling fast fashion pieces. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs people rediscover the clothing trends of the early-2000s, it’s only natural that they’re looking at the beauty and hair trends of the era as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere is the Y2K trend going next?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNot every trends sticks around forever. It would be easy to look at the Y2K aesthetic and shrug it off as a pandemic trend that might quickly disappear. In reality, we’re seeing the opposite happen as the world starts to reopen again. The obsession with the early-2000s is still going strong, continuing through the summer and into autumn. The future of the Y2K aesthetic is by taking the trends of the era and making them more contemporary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe most popular Y2K trends are those that take aspects of the original and modernise them. While stripy and chunky highlights are a signature look of the Y2K aesthetic, they’re easily dated and don’t look contemporary. This hair trend can be modernised by switching out the highlighting technique by applying the colour in a softer way, blending it with your natural shade for a contemporary look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can take inspiration from Dua Lipa, who is a figurehead of the Y2K movement. She keeps her look contemporary by using bright colours in a modern way. Whether it’s lavender eyeshadow or metallic eyeliner, experimenting with colour is an easy way to take any look and give it a Y2K twist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not too late to jump on the Y2K bandwagon. Beauty industry insiders are predicting that colour will remain one of the biggest trends for hair and beauty in upcoming seasons. You can try the powder blue and lilac shades that Drew Barrymore was famous for wearing in the late-90s, or the brown lipstick shades that are both chic and Y2K at once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe love looking to Megan Thee Stallion for inspiration for our Y2K makeup. The singer is famous for using a darker lip colour on her outer lips, before using a lighter shade on the inside of her lips – all while skipping on lipliner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne thing we know for sure is that the Y2K beauty trends aren’t here forever. It’s the perfect time to experiment with these trends and have fun with them.

But could TikTok be the new place to focus your job search?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems TikTok has set its sights on overtaking the niche of LinkedIn by leveraging their multi-billion-dollar app to allow its users to apply for jobs.

It’s essentially a professional networking service that operates online, allowing its users to post their CVs and provide updates on a feed similar to a Twitter or Facebook feed. Employers can also use LinkedIn as a recruiting pool by posting job openings and to update followers on their business development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt offers something for every professional – whether you’re a recruiter or someone looking to go to the next stage of your career. It’s been owned by Microsoft since 2016. In June 2021, LinkedIn currently has over 750 million registered users from over 200 countries across the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLinkedIn allows you to create a profile that documents your career achievements, education, and personal skills in one easy place. It acts as a more in-depth CV, with fellow users being able to provide recommendations and references directly to your profile. You can provide as much information as you want, using different sections of the platform. Businesses can set up a similar profile for their companies, including similar information about their projects, clients, and mission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBusinesses and users can ‘connect’ with each other online, forming a social network that looks just like a real-world professional relationship.

For its launch, TikTok has teamed up with a number of companies who are offering entry-level positions, including Shopify and Target.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow the TikTok Resume system works\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new TikTok resume program is a three-party system. It allows users to search for available job openings, post their video resume as an application, and submit it to the company that is hiring. The feature is already showing promise with brands like Abercrombie \u0026amp; Fitch Co. and Chipotle utilizing the platform during their hiring process. You can even apply to be the next WWE superstar using the TikTok resume program.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe brands that have quickly joined the scheme are those who have been using the platform as part of their digital marketing strategy. Marissa Andrada, the Chief Diversity, Inclusion, and People Officer at Chipotle described the platform as being “ingrained into Chipotle’s DNA” and that they’re “evolving our presence to help bring in top talent to our restaurants”.

Each video application can be up to three-minutes long, allowing candidates to pitch themselves directly on the app towards their potential employer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight now, the TikTok resume program is only opened to candidates based in the United States. With TikTok growing every day, we have no doubt that this program will eventually be rolled out globally to users in other countries. All users however can use the #TikTokResumes hashtag to post their video resume, even if they can’t access opened positions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTikTok has set its eyes firmly on redefining the space currently occupied by LinkedIn as the leading platform for connecting candidates and potential employers. The popular app is encouraging candidates to use the resume program in a way that is “creatively and authentically” showing their potential. There’s no doubt that TikTok’s latest venture is targeted at Gen Z and millennials, who are already fuelling the expansion of the app’s popularity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can explore the TikTok resumes program at www.tiktokresumes.com.

Unlike LinkedIn, TikTok Resumes is a new program and not one that you’ll find many advice guides for. We’ve gone in search of the TikTok-approved advice on how to create a winning TikTok resume.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s how you can craft the perfect TikTok resume:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-\tDO: Highlight why you would be a great asset for a company by highlighting your skills, knowledge, and qualifications.\u003cbr\u003e-\tDON’T: Be afraid to let your personality shine through. Recruiters want to get to know who you are and that’s why video is such a powerful tool. TikTok is all about authentic self-representation and you want to carry that through into your video resume.\u003cbr\u003e-\tDO: Avoid saying your last name or email during your video. It shouldn’t include any personal or confidential information as this will be included later in the application process.\u003cbr\u003e-\tDO: Keep your video up and set to public for one month after posting to allow recruiters enough time to review your TikTok resume.\u003cbr\u003e-\tDON’T: Use music that is too loud. While music is okay, you want to make sure that you can still be heard speaking clearly.\u003cbr\u003e-\tDO: Film your video vertically and use the hashtag #TikTokResumes and use TikTok tools and effects to help share your passion and job experience. The green screen filter and voiceover tool are the perfect choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy TikTok has launched their recruitment program\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like on other apps, there’s an expanding subculture on the TikTok platform called #CareerTok that works exactly like LinkedIn – but in video form. The purpose of the TikTok Resume program is to reimagine what the recruiting and job discovery process is like for the next generation of leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe often think of TikTok as being the home to hashtags about Y2K and cottagecore, but #CareerTok is one of the strongest trends on TikTok. There are over 73.2 million views on the hashtag, with thousands of videos sharing tips and tricks for fellow professionals and job seekers. You’ll find videos where users are sharing their professional advice, employment stories, and tips to help others attain their dream job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Marketing Manager at TikTok, Kayla Dixon, has described the program as “a natural extension of our TikTok College Ambassadors program, where we previously employed hundreds of college students as on-campus brand representatives”. Currently, the recruitment program is aimed at college students and job seekers who are hunting for entry-level jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is this growing subculture on the app that led to the release of Tik Tok resumes, but it’s not the only trend that has led to its release. LinkedIn itself has carried our research that shows that 76% of hiring managers think pre-recorded interviews would help with the candidate selection process. More than 60% of those survived believe that video resumes could one day replace the traditional cover letter.\u003cbr\u003eIn an effort to take on the TikTok expansion, LinkedIn has updated its platform to include a new feature that allows users to add a short video introduction on their profile. \u003cbr\u003eIt’s hard to think that the platform that brought us viral videos, dance routines, and beauty hacks could become a recruitment platform. In the future, LinkedIn might find itself replaced by TikTok. It’s hard to predict where the video platform’s recruiting program will go next. Time will only tell, but we’re excited to see where the video-sharing app will go next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you think of TikTok’s resume program?

For too long, we’ve overlooked our lips when we think about our skincare routine. In fact, this part of your skin deserves the same TLC as the attention that you pay elsewhere on your skin. Your lips are the one of the first parts of your skin that starts to show the signs of aging and it’s one part that everyone sees. While we’ve spent most of the last year hiding our lips away under a mask, it’s time to start giving our lips the attention that they need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour lips are also one of the most delicate areas of your face, constantly exposed to different environmental elements, not to mention the effects of using makeup products. It’s time that we rethink our skincare routine and start to include our lips as part of our treatments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNo one wants to have chapped lips. Just like a dewy glow, soft and kissable lips are something that everyone strives for. If you’ve stumbled onto this article, you’re probably looking for the same effect. We’re deep diving into this overlooked aspect of skincare and sharing our top tips and tricks on how to look after your lips and create the prettiest pout possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eKeep an eye out for our product recommendations and different tips that you can easily incorporate into your skincare routine. Make sure to bookmark this page for the next time that you’re shopping for skincare products. Read on to find out all our tips and tricks for achieving perfectly kissable lips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePreventing chapped lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that we all dread during the winter is chapped lips. As the temperatures start to drop, our lips become dehydrated and start to develop an unpleasant texture. It can make it feel impossible to wear lipstick and can be uncomfortable to talk or eat. The best way to prevent chapped lips is to avoid your lips from becoming dry. You want to start incorporating lip products into your skincare routine and avoid exposing your skin to artificial heat when the temperatures start to drop. One tool that can help keep your lips (and skin!) hydrated is by adding a humidifier to your routine to keep them moisturised.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s one tip that pharmacists and dermatologists swear by and it’s an easy way to shake up your skincare routine. You want to let your humidifier run throughout the night as you sleep, especially during the summer to keep your lips soft. It’s also a multi-tasking product that will help protect your skin from flaring up during the winter, especially if it’s sensitive to irritation. A humidifier is also a tonic for preventing your throat from becoming dry as you sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChoosing the right lip balm for you\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne lip product that we should all be using is lip balm. It’s one of the first beauty products that we start to use as a young child or teenager and it’s something that you want to use throughout your lip. Using a lip balm is a non-negotiable for having soft lips. You’ll often see lip balms advertised as lip butters or lip moisturisers, although they all do the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis product will keep your skin moisturised and lock-in hydration to prevent moisture loss. You want to boost your lips’ natural protective barrier to keep them healthy throughout the winter.\u003cbr\u003eChoosing the right lip balm is essential to forming the correct foundation for your skincare routine. We’re sharing our top tips and tricks on how to choose the perfect lip balm for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLook out for ingredients that your lips will love\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like any product, you want to deep-dive into the ingredients list on your lip balm. You want to make sure it’s packed full of ingredients that will protect and moisturise your lips. Some of the best lip-loving ingredients include jojoba oil and shea butter, which will give your lips long-lasting hydration. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen the temperatures start to drop, you want to use ingredients like avocado oil, cocoa butter, coconut oil, and sunflower oil to protect your lips from the elements. A lip balm is usually the first product that you’ll use before applying a lipstick or liner. As a result, beeswax is a natural ingredient that you’ll find in most lip balms as it helps to add a natural shine to your lips. Carnauba and candelilla waxes are other alternatives that you’ll often find in vegan-friendly lip balms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eKeep your lips protected from the sun\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou don’t want to overlook your lips when you’re thinking about sun protection. It’s a mistake that’s often made and your lips can become sunburnt – just like anywhere else on your body. It’s not as well reported, but skin cancer can develop on your lips – in particular on your bottom lip as the result of excess exposure to the sun. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re applying your daily sunscreen, you want to make sure you’re using a lip balm with SPF in the morning. It’s best to look out for a lip balm with SPF that is made using titanium oxide or zinc oxide as you’ll naturally start to digest the lip balm due to where it is on your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIf a product dries out your lips, get rid of it\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe often believe that there’s no way that a lip balm can try out your lips. In fact, some of them can and will. This fact isn’t a beauty myth. Unlike other skincare products, lip balm is one that you should start to see almost immediate results with. Most skincare products take weeks to see results, but you should start seeing a change in your lips within three days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren’t seeing an improvement in your lips, you want to get rid of your lip balm and swap it out for a different formula.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSometimes the best way to find the right product for you is with a little trial and error.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe lip care routine that will give you soft and juicy lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNow that we’ve shared our tips for finding the best lip balm for your skin, it’s only right that we share with you the perfect lip care routine. Just like any routine, it’s important that you get the steps right and stay consistent with your routine. Consistency is key to keeping your lips hydrated, soft, and looking kissable. Even when you start to get results, you want to keep up with your routine and use these products on a daily basis to maintain your results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStep 1 – Use a scrub\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere are two reasons why you want to be using a scrub to exfoliate your lips. This product helps to remove dry and dead skin cells from your lips in order to keep them smooth and soft. You want to start your lip care routine by using a scrub as it helps your lips better absorb the active ingredients in the rest of your routine. It works just like cleansing your skin and is an important first step that you don’t want to overlook. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlthough exfoliating is important, you don’t want to do it more than twice a week. While it’s easy to find affordable lip scrubs in-store, you can even make your own DIY scrubs. If you’re in a rush, you can exfoliate your lips by buffing them with a soft toothbrush that has some lip balm on it, working the product in circular motion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStep 2 – Use a mask\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother product that you want to be using is a lip mask. There are two popular types that you can incorporate into your lip care routine. Removal gel masks are ideal for giving your lips an instant boost of moisture and hydration. You can use it right before a big event if you want to plump your lips. A leave-on lip treatment mask is something you can incorporate into your night-time routine as it works to nourish your lips while you sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStep 3 - Give your lips the hydration it needs\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to keep your skin hydrated and moisturised by making sure that you reapply your lip balm throughout the day.

For too long, we’ve overlooked our lips when we think about our skincare routine. In fact, this part of your skin deserves the same TLC as the attention that you pay elsewhere on your skin. Your lips are the one of the first parts of your skin that starts to show the signs of aging and it’s one part that everyone sees. While we’ve spent most of the last year hiding our lips away under a mask, it’s time to start giving our lips the attention that they need.",

Whether it’s acne, rosacea, or what skincare products to use while pregnant, dermatologists have all the answers. They’re the experts on skincare and the best people to ask when you have questions. Everyone from influencers to beauty editors and celebrities turn to dermatologists when they have a question. Finding – and affording to have – a dermatologist isn’t easy. \u003cbr\u003eThere are some questions that every dermatologist gets asked. We’re rounding up the seven most common questions that everyone asks their dermatologist – including the answers! Make sure to bookmark this page, so you have a reference for the next time you need a dermatologist’s help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: Does my diet affect acne?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: There’s a common misconception that acne is the direct result of an unhealthy diet. For most people, their acne is the result of their genetics and hormones. That doesn’t mean that your diet can’t play a role in preventing or causing acne. A small group of people can be sensitive to products with dairy ingredients and refined sugars. If you think your diet is the culprit, it’s best to go and speak directly with a dermatologist.\u003cbr\u003eCutting food groups, such as dairy, out of your diet without the approval and support of a dermatologist can lead to other health issues, including disordered eating. If you notice that your acne starts to flare up when you’re eating dairy, you could switch to a plant-based alternative that is lower on the GI index. While oat milk is popular, unsweetened soy milk and almond milk is a better choice. \u003cbr\u003eDairy won’t be the issue if you’re adding a splash of milk to your coffee in the morning. You’ll need to be consuming it in large volumes or through food like a whey protein supplement for it to impact your skin.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, changing your diet isn’t enough to stop your acne breakouts. You’ll also need to undergo prescription treatment alongside changing your diet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: Is the SPF in my moisturiser the same as the SPF in my sunscreen?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA: If you’re ever walked around a department store, you’ll have spotted skincare products that include SPF as one of their main selling points. The SPF that you find in your daily moisturiser undergoes the same testing for the SPF in sunscreen. If your moisturiser says that it is SP50, it will provide an SPF of 30. \u003cbr\u003eThe difference between a moisturiser and sunscreen is that their formulas have a shorter staying power. These formulas are less resistant and have a thinner consistency than sunscreen, meaning that you don’t get the same protection from your moisturiser. \u003cbr\u003eIt’s also worth highlighting that SPF moisturisers don’t necessarily also include UVA protection. If you’re looking for SPF, you want to make sure it’s also protecting you against UV ageing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: Do popular collagen supplements really work?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA: Collagen supplements are everywhere that you look on social media. Everyone from celebrities to influencers are promoting this ‘wonder’ product and selling it as though it’s the fountain of youth. While collagen supplements are cleverly marketed, they’re not all that they’re hyped up to be.\u003cbr\u003eThe main thing going against collagen supplements is that there’s no evidence to suggest that they work in the first place. What makes it difficult is that collagen is essentially a protein. If you consume it in a supplement form, your body will break it down into amino acids and digest it, passing it through your body. It won’t go directly to your skin to give you the desired anti-aging effect. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re willing to spend the money on collagen supplements, you could invest that money elsewhere. Collagen supplements are some of the most expensive products in the beauty industry and can make you feel like you’re putting money down the drain. \u003cbr\u003eInstead of using collagen supplements, focus on wearing sunscreen and following a healthy diet. Keep on top of your skincare routine and use retinol as your main anti-aging treatment. Until there’s data to suggest that collagen supplements work, it’s best skipping them for now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: Will my constant breakouts go away?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA: It’s easy to feel frustrated when you’re constantly dealing with breakouts on your skin. It’s a common misconception that they’re something only teenagers deal with. Most women deal with breakouts through their thirties and beyond. If you want to get rid of your breakouts, the best way is to use an anti-acne skincare routine. \u003cbr\u003eThe benefit of these products is that they’re often ideal for tackling the causes of premature aging. You can have the best of both worlds, helping your skin look better while tackling your breakouts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: When should I start having injectables?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA: Injectables are becoming one of the most popular treatments within the skincare world. One question that every dermatologist gets is what is the right age to start taking injectables. Can you be too young or too old for injectables? \u003cbr\u003eMost people choose to start using injectables from their mid-thirties onwards. However, it’s more about the condition of your skin than your age – particularly how your skin is aging. There is no ‘right’ age for starting injectables as your skin’s aging process will depend on your genetics. Everything from your diet to sun exposure and stress will impact your skin’s aging process. \u003cbr\u003eYou could have two people of the same age with drastically different skin. If you’ve had little sun exposure and your skin is aging slowly, you don’t need to worry about injectables. If you’re the same age and spend most of your time outdoors in the sun, you’re likely to start experiencing lines and a loss of volume in your face earlier. \u003cbr\u003eYour ethnicity and complexion will also impact what age you should start injectables at. If you have blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair complexion, you’ll start to age earlier than someone with Asian skin due to their melanin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: How do I know if my skincare routine is working?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA: When you spend hundreds (and possibly thousands!) on your skincare, you want to make sure that it’s working. Most skincare products can take weeks for you to start to see results. Consistency is key and you shouldn’t expect your skin to transform overnight. \u003cbr\u003ePeople get frustrated with their skincare routine when they’re not seeing results. The main problem is that people don’t know what they need and don’t need in their skincare routine. It’s easy to fall into the hype around the latest must-have skincare product, which might not work for your skin or even be needed in your routine. Niacinamide and tranexamic acid are two of these ingredients that not everyone needs, even though they’re constantly talked about.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s easy to assume that you need to be using dozens of skincare products. The best skincare routines are those that focus on a smaller set of products that offer multiple benefits. You want every product to be working overtime to protect and rejuvenate your skin. Identify what your skincare concerns are and look for the ingredients that can target multiple issues. \u003cbr\u003eVitamin A is one ingredient that almost everyone should be using. It can fulfil the place of retinol, niacinamide, and tranexamic acid. It’s an anti-aging ingredient that also works for tackling imperfections like acne and pigmentation. \u003cbr\u003eMost dermatologist end up taking their client’s skincare routine and removing products, instead of adding products. Take a close look at every skincare product in your routine and ask if you really need it. If it’s not working, swap it out for something that will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQ: Will anyone be able to tell if I’ve started to have Botox?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA: One thing that puts people off investing in Botox is the idea that it’ll be easy to tell that they’ve had work done. We’ve all heard of horror stories and know of celebrities who are daunted by the media for their excessive use of Botox to prevent aging and to fill out their face.\u003cbr\u003eIf your Botox is applied properly, no one will be able to tell that you’ve had work done unless you tell them. You want to make sure that you’re working with a licensed aesthetician, who knows what they’re doing. It’s always a good idea to ask to see a reference or portfolio of their previous work. \u003cbr\u003eYour aesthetician will work closely with you to correctly inject your Botox. Most clients will focus on softening strong lines and applying Botox in a way that releases tension in the face. Botox has evolved greatly since the days of the ‘90s, when people were often said to have ‘frozen faces’ and couldn’t move their features. The key to keeping your Botox looking natural is to microdose and undergo a strict treatment of Botox that ensures you’re not going for more appointments than you need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat questions would you ask a dermatologist if you could?

It’s hyped up just as much as \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/everything-that-you-need-to-know-about-retinol\"\u003eretinol\u003c/a\u003e and SPF – making it a superhero for your routine. Vitamin C is one ingredient that brings dozens of benefits for your skin. It’s infused with everything from antioxidants to properties that rejuvenate your skin’s collagen to prevent pigmentation. We’re taking a deep dive into the world of vitamin C to find out everything you need to know about this ingredient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re a newbie to the ingredient or a longer-term user, this guide takes you through everything you need to know about vitamin C. If you’ve landed on this article, you’re probably considering adding \u003ca href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/vitamin-c-serum-benefits#benefits\"\u003evitamin C\u003c/a\u003e to your skincare routine. Spoiler alert: it’s one ingredient that everyone can benefit from using. You want to make sure to bookmark this page as a reference once you start using vitamin C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Vitamin C and what does it do?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVitamin C is a natural ingredient that is safe for most skin types, and you can layer it with other products, like AHAs and sunscreen. Vitamin C does virtually everything that your skin needs. It’s one of the most powerful and potent antioxidants on the market, protecting your skin from environmental damage. As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects your skin from pollution, brightens its complexion, boosts your collagen production, and helps inhibit pigmentation. It’s one ingredient that every dermatologist raves about, with most of them recommending that you should use it topically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile vitamin C is something that you can get from your diet, you have to consume a toxic level of it to get the same antioxidant benefits as using it topically in your skincare. Vitamin C is able to stimulate your collagen, because your fibroblasts that create new collagen have receptors for vitamin C. These receptors enhance your skin cell’s DNA, encouraging it to produce more collagen to transform your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the benefits of vitamin C that most people talk about is its skin-brightening properties. With all the trends focusing on the idea of \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-skincare-tips-you-need-to-create-a-dewy-glow\"\u003enatural skin with a dewy glow,\u003c/a\u003e it’s no surprise that vitamin C has become increasingly popular. It helps to brighten your skin’s complexion by preventing the production of pigmentation to keep your skin looking clear and smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother one of the most popular uses of vitamin C serum is as an anti-ageing treatment. It stimulates your collagen and elastin production to prevent skin sagging by tightening your skin. The antioxidative properties of vitamin C protect your skin from oxidative stress, such as sun damage, by preventing free radical damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to look for with vitamin C\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust like other active ingredients – such as retinol – there are things you want to look out for. Not all vitamin C products are made equally, meaning that you want to find the one that works best for your skin. Ascorbic acid – also known as\u003ca href=\"https://www.beautybay.com/fr/p/the-ordinary/100-l-ascorbic-acid-powder/\"\u003e L-ascorbic \u003c/a\u003eacid – is a natural form of vitamin C that is also the most highly researched. Ironically, it’s also the most unstable form of vitamin C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe type of vitamin C that is used in a product depends on the rest of the formulation and the way that the formula is delivered to the skin. Packaging is something we often tell you to ignore when looking at products. The cliché of “don’t judge a book by its cover” is usually correct, but not when it comes to vitamin C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re \u003ca href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/get-brighter-skin-vitamin-c\"\u003eshopping around for vitamin C,\u003c/a\u003e you want to look for the correct packaging for your product. Keep an eye out for a sealed container that has an airless pump and that comes in a darker tinted bottle. You can also use an encapsulated powder or vitamin C that is delivered in single or short-use shots that keep the active ingredient at its most potent before it is delivered to the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou also want to consider how you use and keep your vitamin C products. It’s always best to keep the lid on the product and you want to make sure that you don’t leave it sitting in your bathroom. The fluctuation in heat from the bath or shower will degrade and destabilise your vitamin C. You’ll notice that your vitamin C will have oxidized if the product starts to change slightly in colour. You can still continue to use it in this state as it shows that there is still a good concentration of vitamin C. Any changes that are more obvious will mean that you have to discard your product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKnow the % of your vitamin C in the product you’re using\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVitamin C is proven to be active when it has a concentration of just 0.6% and above. The higher the percentage of the concentration, the more serious the effects of the vitamin C. As you go higher with the concentration, the skin begins to become more sensitive. Whatever way you want to use your vitamin C, you need to start with a lower concentration and slowly move to a higher concentration overtime. These are the golden rules for using any active ingredients that can cause a reaction to your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePotential skin irritation is the only major downside that comes from using vitamin C. If you use it as part of your daily skincare routine, you can expect to see your skin tone and complexion start to brighten over time. It also acts as an antioxidant in partnership with your daily SPF. You want to avoid going over the 5% concentration threshold without good reason. If you want to start small and avoid irritation, it’s a good idea to use a face wash or a mask with vitamin C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDepending on the sensitivity of your skin, you might feel your skin start to tingle even with a concentration of 2%. If you think that your skin is more sensitive, it’s a good idea to use it alongside a face cream to prevent irritation. When your vitamin C concentration hits 10% or above, the ingredient becomes more active. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVitamin C is one ingredient that you don’t need to be using every day. Most people choose to incorporate into their skincare routine two to three times a week. The key to seeing results is to be consistent with your vitamin C use and to keep it as part of your routine for at least eight weeks. It’s after the eight-week mark that you will start to see results from your vitamin C.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re planning on using vitamin C as a way to tackle sunspots, you need to gradually work your skin up to a 20% concentration. This level is clinically shown to be effective for treating sunspots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to use Vitamin C in your skincare routine\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVitamin C is one skincare ingredient that you’ll usually want to incorporate into your morning routine. It can help to protect your skin from pollution and it’s a multitasking ingredient that is amongst the most flexible of any active ingredient. There’s no hard and fast rules about using vitamin C, meaning that you can also incorporate it as a part of your night-time routine if you prefer to. The key is to make sure that you’re being consistent and keeping your vitamin C as part of your regular skincare routine to start seeing results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the easiest and most effective ways of using vitamin C is through a serum or in a powder form that is mixed with your serum. Most dermatologists will recommend using a serum as the form of delivery. You want to be careful with which ingredients you’re using alongside your vitamin C. Vitamin E is one ingredient that it is often paired with to help boost its antioxidant properties. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re making the effort to incorporate vitamin C into your skincare routine, then you want to make sure you’re also using a daily SPF. If you’re using vitamin C to tackle pigmentation, you want to make sure you’re protecting your skin with an SPF to prevent it being exposed to further sun damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne ingredient that vitamin C is often used in partnership with is hyaluronic acid. These two ingredients are the duo that your skincare routine has been waiting for. Both have powerful anti-ageing properties and work together to hydrate and protect your skin. Using the vitamin C and hyaluronic acid together can reduce the risk of any irritation that might be triggered by your vitamin C by keeping your skin moisturised and aiding the healing process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAdding vitamin C to your daily routine can help protect it from premature ageing and keep it hydrated to give you a brighter complexion and radiant glow. If you’re thinking of adding it to your routine, it’s a good idea to wrap your head around the complexities of the ingredient.

With less human-to-human interaction, the only alternative that we are left with is shopping online. \u003cbr\u003eSo, while consumers were already inclined to shopping online even before the pandemic, the post-pandemic era has seen an unprecedented boost in online commerce. \u003cbr\u003eLet’s dig a little deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePre-Pandemic Consumer Behavior \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe worldwide crises have induced a major shift in how consumers behave. And, it had a radical impact on the growth of the eCommerce industry. \u003cbr\u003eSee, eCommerce was already on the rise and brands were utilizing livestreams to connect with consumers effectively. \u003cbr\u003eAlibaba’s Taobao has already been using livestream quite successfully. Seeing the eCommerce giant’s success, Amazon launched its own livestreaming platform too. \u003cbr\u003eThis shows that although the post-pandemic scenario increased the demand for online marketplaces, it was already booming industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePost-Pandemic Shopping Trends\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe lifestyle of most people has changed a lot during these testing times. Most people wouldn’t leave their homes either because of restrictions or because they don’t want to. \u003cbr\u003eAs staying indoors became a norm, consumers were naturally more inclined to buying everything online. \u003cbr\u003eThis radical change could’ve taken years or even decades otherwise. But, we are living in an unpredictable world. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, while online shopping was on the rise already, after the pandemic, people even started buying their groceries online. Something that no one could have imagined otherwise. \u003cbr\u003eThis is just one category of consumer goods that found popularity in the online shopping industry. There are others like house essentials and cleaning supplies that people use in their daily lives. \u003cbr\u003eIn the US alone, consumers spent $211.5 billion on eCommerce in the 2nd quarter of 2020. This was a whopping 31.8% quarter-on-quarter growth. \u003cbr\u003eJust like brands have changed the way they do business in the post-pandemic world, consumer preferences have also shifted. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, the more important thing to note for a brand is that the new trends are going to catch up even after the pandemic ends. \u003cbr\u003eLet’s take a look at them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLocal Buying Has Increased\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003ePeople are more and more becoming community-focused as far as shopping is concerned. The first reason for that is that it’s convenient, and the second is that they want to provide support to local brands and businesses. \u003cbr\u003eThe important thing to note here is that the trend seems to continue for a long time even after the crises. \u003cbr\u003eAs a brand, you can take this opportunity to glance at your neighborhood and find local prospects that you might have missed in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eEcommerce is Booming\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA study reports that online buying has increased by 53% because a lot of people had to self-isolate and remain at home. Be it the working class, students, or entrepreneurs. \u003cbr\u003eThe rising trend of eCommerce post-pandemic tells us that people are starting to trust online retailers more and more. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, as brands try to gain credibility by offering top-notch services/products, it’s only going to get more common. \u003cbr\u003eAs a brand, you can leverage this trend in your favor by offering convenient home delivery and check-out services on your online store. \u003cbr\u003eLivestreaming is a great way to keep everything streamlined and straightforward for your prospects. You can provide a simple payment option to make things further convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTouch-Free Payments\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s also understandable that people now prefer to pay with safer methods. Around 40% of people would likely use a touch-free payment method due to obvious reasons.\u003cbr\u003eAs a helpful brand, it’s your duty to help consumers feel safe and comfortable. What better than offering an online checkout method?\u003cbr\u003eIf you are using livestreams to sell your products, you can redirect users to the product page after they like your product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eConsumers are More Cost-Conscious\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe crisis has been a testing phase for many people, especially when it comes to financial matters. A lot of consumers admitted that they have been affected financially because of the pandemic. \u003cbr\u003eThis most often means that consumers will be conscious of their spending. And, if they find something that’s cheaper than something they have been buying, they will probably prefer that. \u003cbr\u003eAs a consumer-centric brand, what you can do is, offer special discounts to your audience whenever you can. Of course, you don’t want to hurt your margins. \u003cbr\u003eBut, helping them in their times of need can establish you as a sensitive and helpful brand. Which ultimately will help you build brand loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eConsumers are Trying New Products and Brands\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother noticeable trend that the retail industry has seen is that consumers are trying to get in touch with new brands and try new products \u003cbr\u003eThe reason can be stock availability, convenience, curiosity, or accessibility. But, the point is, once they shift to a new brand, they tend to stay with them. \u003cbr\u003eAs a brand, this offers a good opportunity to present your brand or products in front of new audiences in an effective way. \u003cbr\u003eWhile there are multiple ways of doing that, Jumble suggests livestreaming.

The humidity, combined with your naturally frizzy hair, can be a girl’s worst nightmare when the temperatures start to rise. Frizz is when your hair doesn’t align straight and is caused by moisture that swells-up your hair. Your hair naturally becomes frizzier as the humidity around you goes above the level of moisture and water in your hair. Whether you’re indoor or outdoors, your hair naturally absorbs moisture from the air. After your hair has consumed all this moisture, it starts to swell and become frizz.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile humidity is largely considered to be the leading cause of frizzy hair, there are other factors to consider. Your genetics and damage to your hair are two other leading factors. Lifestyle and body changes, like pregnancy hormones, can also lead to frizzy hair. Your hormones can increase the length of your hair cycle, which leads to less shedding, giving your hair a frizzy appearance.\u003cbr\u003eNow that you know how frizz is caused, you probably want to know how to tackle it. We’re sharing our top tips and tricks, along with the best product recommendations. You want to make sure to bookmark this article and come back to it throughout the summer or when you notice your hair starting to become frizzy. Remember, it can happen at any time – not just the summer!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to stop your hair becoming frizzy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs long as your hormones aren’t fluctuating because of medication or pregnancy, and if you haven’t got damage hair, the cure to banishing frizzy hair is easy. It’s all about keeping your hair hydrated and moisturised, regardless of what hair type you have. You want to be on the look out for anti-humectant ingredients that are included in anti-frizz products. These products usually include natural nourishing ingredients like avocado oil, shea butter, castor oil, and olive oil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to treat frizz when you have curly or wavy hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you have curly or wavy hair, it can be a little trickier to keep your hair frizz-free. The issue is that your hair will naturally be lacking moisture, meaning that your hair is prone to frizz. The worst thing that you can do is to simply lather your hair in oil and think the job is done. \u003cbr\u003eYou should be using a shampoo and conditioner to cleanse and hydrate your hair, choosing products that work for your hair type. Your cleanser shouldn’t be too harsh for you to use. You want to incorporate hair masks and conditioners that can add extra hydration to your hair and provide protein to help with hair growth. It’s all about treating your hair cuticles, including conditioning it to seal in your cuticles.\u003cbr\u003eOnce you’ve nailed the basics of your haircare routine – specially your shampoo and conditioner – you can start to think about styling products. Keep an eye out for detangling products that also protect and nourish your hair. Once you’ve mastered the styling products, you can go ahead and use a hair oil. \u003cbr\u003eYour goal with curly or wavy hair is to keep it as hydrated and moisturised as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to prevent frizz with straight hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eEven if you have naturally straight hair, you can still experience frizz. While the reasons are different than those for curly hair, you can still experience frizz with straight hair. It is usually caused by colour damage or breakage, when the hair’s cuticle layers have opened up and become damaged, giving the appearance of frizz.\u003cbr\u003eEvery time that you style, straighten, and blow-dry your hair, the damage adds up and gives your hair that unwanted frizz. If you’re someone who relies on chemical hair treatments and heat styling, you can damage and roughen your hair cuticles, leading to frizz.\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone is willing to give up their highlights, flat iron, and styling products. You want to protect your hair by taking proactive steps to give your hair some TLC. It’s worth investing in heat protectants and treat your hair to regular treatments to protect the cuticles and follicles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOur recommendations for frizzy hair products\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAre you ready to shake up your haircare shelf and add some anti-frizz products?

After a year in quarantine, we’re all ready to brush away the cobwebs and rediscover the content of our makeup bags. Staying on top – and predicting – the beauty trends for 2021 is a difficult task. We’ve all seen how quickly trends can be born and die under the influence of social media. \u003cbr\u003eEven Jackie Aina, one of social media’s most powerful beauty influencers has said its hard to keep up with trends because they are ‘so unpredictable’. The makeup mogul told Harpers Bazaar that trends could go either way – with people embracing minimalism or making a return to the days of ‘full glam’ makeup. \u003cbr\u003eWhile we don’t have a crystal ball into the future, we do have some educated guesses as to where beauty trends may go in 2021. Grab a pen or your makeup bag, it’s time to rediscover your favourite eyeliner or concealer. After a year of sitting at home in front of our computer screen, it’s time to rediscover the real world and the power of makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFocus on the eyes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith masks looking like they’re sticking around for a while longer, it’s no surprise that our attention has focused on the eyes. Your eyes have always been the window to your soul but they take on an even more dominant role while you’re wearing a mask. One trend that we’re seeing all over TikTok and Instagram is ‘expressive eyes’. \u003cbr\u003eThis trend is the perfect example of the art behind makeup trends, with these expressive eyes being an opportunity for you to show off your personality and emotions. It’s all about having fun and experimenting with different colors of eyeliners, various eyeshadow textures, and even unique eyelashes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFalsies all day\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith all the focus on our eyes, you don’t want to forget about your eyelashes. It’s hard to go for a full glam look while wearing a face mask. Skip your dramatic lipstick shade and instead indulge in a pair of your favourite false eyelashes. \u003cbr\u003eYou want to focus on finding a style that adds volume and definition to your eyes. The rumours are true – it’s time to bring back the false eyelashes. What we love about falsies is their versatility. There are hundreds – if not thousands – of different styles for you to choose from. Finding your perfect eyelashes is like discovering your go-to lipstick shade. Once you’ve found the one, you’ll never go back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBring back the 90s\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can thank Gen Z for bringing back the 90s trends. The younger generation on TikTok and Instagram are discovering 90s trends for the first time, bringing them back to the front of the beauty industry.\u003cbr\u003eThe classic 90s beauty trends are all about swapping out soft pink hues for more muted colors. You want to be incorporating different shades of green, including pistachio and sage, along with baby blues and earth-tone tans. \u003cbr\u003eDon’t be surprised if you start seeing people wearing graphic eyeliner, including white shades, and even baby blue eyeliner. It seems like beauty influencers are taking a break from wearing shimmers and instead are focusing on matte shades.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGo further back to the ‘60s\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not just the 90s that we’re throwing back to. Beauty trends are going even further back to look at the 60s for inspiration. You can thank Ariana Grande’s new-found love for all things 60s-inspired as fuelling this trend. You can expect to see everything from graphic shapes made with liner and eyeshadow to bright-eyed shadows and baby pink lipstick.\u003cbr\u003eDon’t forget to finish off your look with a voluminous high ponytail and a silk headband.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEmbrace your natural skin\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one thing that we’ve learnt during COVID-19, it’s that we don’t want to be spending our time applying layers upon layers of concealer and foundation. The days of cakey foundation are behind us. Full-coverage foundation is here to stay, but what you want is to achieve the most natural-looking complexion. \u003cbr\u003eFocus on finding your perfect match with a foundation that works with your master skin tone and under tones. It may take some trial and error, but it’s worth searching around for your perfect foundation shade.\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest trends in beauty right now is glass skin with a dewy glow. You’ll often see this trend being called ‘demi-matte’, which is a blend of a dewy glow with a semi-matte finish. You get the best of both worlds and texture to your skin, with all the benefits of a long-wearing and natural foundation.\u003cbr\u003eYou want to create as much of a natural skin-like finish to your foundation as possible. The success of Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty complexion products is due to her ability to create soft matte shades that give you a radiant glow without being too shiny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBring colour to your look\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t overlook the power of adding colour to your look. Take the opportunity to go out of your comfort zone and experiment with a new shade. Colour is the perfect way to brighten your mood and try something new with your makeup look. If you’re looking to try something new, look no further than a bright eyeshadow shade. There are dozens of colours for you to choose from this season, all of which are right on trend.\u003cbr\u003eKeep an eye out for shades like bubblegum pink, magenta purple, lavender, and sky blue. While there’s a focus on minimalist makeup, you can take an everyday look and turn it from day to night with the swipe of a brighter colour. A sage green or mellow yellow can be just as impactful as a vibrant jewel-tone hue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBuying from small and independent brands\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one trend that we’re fully on board with for 2021, it’s supporting small and independent brands. Thanks to TikTok and Instagram, it’s never been easier to discover independent beauty brands. We’ve all seen beauty brands blow up thanks to social media after going viral.\u003cbr\u003eMore consumers are actively seeking to support up-and-coming businesses, including black-owned and female-founded beauty brands. The momentum that started during the pandemic is expected to carry through to 2021 and beyond as these small brands continue to release game-changing products. \u003cbr\u003eIf you want to change the beauty industry for the better, it’s time to start supporting the next generation of brands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSustainable beauty\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like the fashion industry, the beauty industry is finally experiencing its own green revolution. Everything from micro-beads to chemical ingredients can cause chaos for our eco-systems, including coral reefs. As consumers become more educated and make steps towards becoming sustainable, it’s no surprise that beauty brands are making changes to meet this growing demand.\u003cbr\u003eThere are dozens of vegan beauty brands that have come onto our radar in recent months. It’s never been easier to embrace ‘green’ and ‘all-natural’ beauty products than now. Part of the sustainable beauty industry involves brands becoming fully cruelty-free. While animal testing is banned in most of the world, brands have to subject their products to third-party animal testing before they can sell their products in China.\u003cbr\u003eOne example of a sustainable beauty brand is Biossance, which describes itself as the ‘most sustainable and only EWG-verified brand’.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLip stains and natural colors\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one thing that we’ve had to deal with over the last year, it’s our lipstick smudging on the inside of our mask. We’ve seen a rise in lip tints and natural-looking lip products that are easier to wear and less likely to end up all over your face and mask. The beauty of these shades is that they’re easy to wear and work with any makeup look.\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most popular colours for 2021 is peach, a twist on the usual coral orange shade that becomes prominent during the summer months. Instead of picking up a scarlet red liquid lipstick, why not try a peach pink lip stain?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t forget about blush\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the few face products that is having a major moment in 2021 is blush. It’s one product that is less likely to come off inside your mask and gives you a seamless makeup look that will carry you from day to night.\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to get inventive with a bright colour to help wake up and rejuvenate your face. Blush is one of the biggest trends for summer 2021 and shows no sign of slowing down. You can blend your blush into your cheeks, and up to your temples and brow bone to give you an all-over flush look. It’s best to try and recreate this look with a gentle hand and make sure it blends with your eye makeup look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these 2021 makeup trends have you been wearing?

The beauty of hair feathers is how easy they are to use. They’re a total gamechanger and will transform your look in a low maintenance way. You can keep your feather in for weeks and let it blend in with your natural hair. You want to keep the feather near the front of your head or wear it underneath for a cool peek out effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCottagecore Dresses\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eTikTok is all about the cottagecore aesthetic. Depending on what side of TikTok you’re on, you may have no idea what we’re talking about. Cottagecore is a fashion aesthetic that started on Tumblr and Pinterest before making its way onto TikTok. It’s set to become one of the biggest trends of summer 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can think of cottagecore as being Jane Austen meets Bridgerton. It’s all about feminine silhouettes, floral prints, and comfortable clothing that you could wear while napping or curling up with a good book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThese dresses are perfect for summer as they tend to be flowy and oversized, making them ideal for when the temperatures start to rise.\u003cbr\u003eIf you don’t have a pretty ruffle dress in your summer wardrobe, what are you waiting for?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eContour Mapping\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDid you think that you had finally mastered the art of contouring? Well, it’s all changed again. We’re all used to contouring with a bronzer or cream powder, but contour mapping is an entirely different beast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eContour mapping involves drawing dozens of small squares in different colours across your face, as though you’re applying your other makeup products. You want to blend out neutral shades, your normal concealer colour, bronzer shades, and a blusher hue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’re not sure where we stand on the contour mapping trend. It’s one of the newest trends but it’s time consuming and not something you want to do right as you’re running out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCruella DeVil Hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eTikTok is no stranger to the world of wigs and extravagant hair. After the new Cruella film dropped, our ‘For Your Page’ was full of videos of girls rocking the two-toned white and black Cruella hair that Emma Stone wore in the film. Part of the reason for this trend is that it fits right in with the E-girl beauty standards. TikTok is still obsessing over the two-tone Narcissa Malfoy hairstyle, so it’s no surprise that Cruella is also having her moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat we love about this trend is that it’s easy to recreate at home. You don’t need to splash out on a trip to the salon to recreate this two-tone look, in fact, it’s usually easier to do it at home. If you have blonde or brunette hair, you’ll usually only need to choose one colour to dye half your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t feel like you have to stick to the black and white Cruella colours either. Think outside the box and choose colours that speak to your personality and make you want to show off your new look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’ve all heard the saying – change the hair, change the woman.

Love them or hate them, it seems like corsets are here to stay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003ePart of their popularity is that they fit into both the Y2K aesthetic and the cottagecore aesthetic. The one thing to remember if you’re buying a corset is that it shouldn’t be uncomfortable to wear. It’s a common misconception that a corset only fits once you’ve lost the ability to breath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt may take some trial and error to find the perfect corset for you, but it’s worth going on the hunt. You want to choose one that you can see yourself styling on a daily basis, whether it’s with jeans or under a button-up blouse. Corsets are an easy way to achieve that envious hourglass shape and to accentuate your natural curves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBangs a la Farrah Fawcett\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere’s a growing niche on TikTok that is obsessed with all things 70s inspired.

The hair flip and bouncy curls show that you’re sexy, carefree, and ready to party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking to recreate this look at home, you can use hot rollers for the most authentic look, placing them from the top of your hair down. The secret is to always lift and bounce the hot roller. When you don’t have time to wait around on hot tools, you can use a curling wand or straighteners to achieve a similar look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePerfect Complexion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one makeup trend that we’re seeing on TikTok, it’s finding the perfect match for complexion products.

The secret to achieving this trend is to look for products that offer full or buildable coverage. We’ve seen products like the KVD Vegan Beauty Good Apple Perfecting Foundation Balm, and the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter Concealer all go viral in recent weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhich of these TikTok trends will you be rocking this summer?

The last thing you want is to be applying red lipstick onto cracked lips.

You might think of them as an unnecessary add-on, but they’re a gamechanger for helping you get a smooth finish and will boost the longevity of your red lipstick. You can also use a blot of foundation or concealer over your lips to help cancel out your natural lip shade to make the red pop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s a good idea to keep some micellar water and cotton buds on hand to help clean up any mistakes you make during the application process.

It’ll be raining one moment, and the next you’ve got record breaking temperatures. This summer, we’re committed to being prepared for whatever heatwave comes our way. While we love a chance to sit outside with a cocktail and sunbath (with SPF on!), it can make getting dressed a little tricky. No one wants to wear layers upon layers of clothes during a heatwave but finding weather-appropriate clothing can be difficult. ",

We all know the importance of applying SPF. The sun and its UV rays can accelerate premature aging and damage your skin’s natural protective barrier. When it comes to your skincare routine, the sun is something you can’t afford to overlook. We’re taking an in-depth look at what you should be including in your everyday sun care routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe importance of SPF\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing to remember is that SPF isn’t optional and it’s not a seasonal staple. Unlike your fake tan, SPF is something you want to be using year-round. If you want to protect your skin from UV rays, you need to be applying SPF on a daily basis. Using SPF every once in a while isn’t enough to look after your skin. Consistency is always key for your skincare routine.\u003cbr\u003eWhile the sun’s vitamin D can benefit your skin and brighten your mood, you want to ensure you’re also protecting your skin from sun damage. Continued exposure to the sun can lead to premature aging, including age spots and sagging as your skin loses its firmness and collagen production.\u003cbr\u003ePrevention is always better than the cure. Without wearing sunscreen, your skin will be prone to everything from sunburn to hyperpigmentation and fine lines. It’s important to mention the role that SPF plays in protecting you from skin cancer.\u003cbr\u003eThe Skin Cancer Foundation recommend using a daily sunscreen with at least SPF 15 to reduce your risk of squamous cell carcinoma by 40% and lower your melanoma risk by 50%. It only takes a 30 seconds to apply your SPF, but it can be a gamechanger in protecting your health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUsing SPF in your daily routine\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou might think that moisturiser is the final step of your skincare routine. While this is true for your night-time regime, your daytime routine should always end with your sunscreen. You want to be applying an SPF to anywhere on your body that is going to be exposed to the sun. Regardless of what you’re wearing, this will usually be your face and hands.\u003cbr\u003eYou want to have a separate SPF for your face and one for your body. Apply both SPFs around 20 minutes before you head outside. Even if it’s raining and cloudy outdoors, you want to be wearing your SPF. Even if you don’t see the sun, it’s always there, lingering in the background. You also don’t need to be sitting outside to be exposed to UV rays. Sitting by a window is enough for your body to come into contact with the sun.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not enough to just put your SPF on once a day. You want to be carrying your sunscreen with you every day to reapply throughout the day. The usual rule of thumb is to reapply your SPF every two to three hours on a sunny day. On cloudy days, you can usually reapply your SPF around the same time you’re adding a fresh coat of lipg gloss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the right amount of SPF to use?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most common questions about incorporating sunscreen into your routine is how much should you be using? It’s not an exact science and everyone’s skin is different. You want to be using enough sunscreen to cover your exposed skin, including areas of your face like your ears and neck. \u003cbr\u003eUsually, a teaspoon of sunscreen is enough to cover your face, although this will depend on the consistency of your product. You want to be using enough that it gives you a coat of SPF to protect your skin without missing out on any parts of your face.\u003cbr\u003eYour sunscreen should cover everything from your chest and decolletage to your ears and hairline. Don’t forget about your lips! Chapped lips can be caused by dehydration in the summer as well as the winter. \u003cbr\u003eYou want to make sure you’re using the right level of SPF for the climate. As a general rule, you should always be wearing at least SPF15. When you’re spending the day outdoor, you want to make sure you’re using an SPF30 or higher. Your local supermarket will usually stock at least SPF30 or SPF50 for you to use. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re heading on vacation, you can find a higher SPF sunscreen if needed. It’s always best to go up with your SPF than to be using one that doesn’t provide enough protection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo I need to be wearing SPF?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eEveryone should be wearing sunscreen, regardless of their age or gender. The only category of people who can’t wear sunscreen are babies under 6 months as their skin is too sensitive. Instead, you should be keeping them out of the sun and adding sun-protective clothing. These tips are also great for both adults and kids alike.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re not already wearing a daily SPF, this is a sign to start today. Every skin tone should be using SPF. The sun doesn’t discrimination, regardless of what your skin undertones or color is. Whether you tan or don’t tan, you should be using an SPF every day.\u003cbr\u003eWhile it’s true that darker skin tones can be a little more resilient to sun damage, they are also susceptible to the same skin induced issues and sun burns. On the flip side, those with darker skin tones are often more likely to experience skin cancer, because they believe they’re less likely to be at risk of sun damage. \u003cbr\u003eThankfully, as the beauty industry involves and becomes more inclusive, it is easier to find sunscreens that do not leave a white or ashy cast on your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the best type of SPF to use?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou’re spoilt for choice of sunscreens as the industry wakes up to the importance of using SPF every day. There are dozens of sunscreens to choose from that offer protection from UVA and UVB rays. Just like your beauty products, sunscreens include active ingredients that help to protect your skin from sun damage and prevent UV rays attacking your skin.\u003cbr\u003eThe most popular types are either chemical or mineral SPFs. It’s usually a matter of preference when deciding which one you should be using.\u003cbr\u003eMineral SPFs are usually less irritating and a good choice for those with sensitive skin as it sits on your skin’s surface, while still blocking out the harmful UV rays. This type of sunscreen is also known as ‘physical’ SPF and contains minerals like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. They block out the UV rays from penetrating into your skin.\u003cbr\u003eChemical SPFs have a thinner consistency, making them ideal for wearing under your makeup and easily absorbs into your skin. This type of sunscreen is made with chemical ingredients like avobenzone and octisalate. They work by absorbing the UV rays before they can damage your skin.\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose to mix and match these types of sunscreens, depending on whether you’re wearing makeup, or settle on whichever one works best for you. Most of the sunscreens you find on the market are actually a blend of mineral and chemical ingredients. Both physical and chemical SPFs are equally as effective, making it a personal preference as to which one will work best for you.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s worth remembering that you need to be using a dedicated SPF and not relying on the sun protection in other beauty products. These products offer an add-on protection that helps to top-up the SPF in your sunscreen, but you should not be relying on them as an independent sunscreen. \u003cbr\u003eThe Skin Cancer Foundation recommend that the best SPF you can use is the one you’re most likely to use. As long as the sunscreen gives you the protection you need and has at least an SPF of 15, you’re good to go! It may take some trial and error, but you’re guaranteed to eventually find a sunscreen that works for you and your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to remove SPF\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like your makeup, you want to make sure you’re removing your SPF at the end of the day. Cleansing should be the focal point of your skincare routine to remove impurities and dirt from your skin. \u003cbr\u003eUsing an SPF is like having hairspray in your hair. It sticks to your skin and won’t move until you remove it. You should be double cleansing when wearing a sunscreen as it helps to break down your SPF before removing dead skin cells. You can use an oil or balm cleanser as your first step before following it up with a gentle face wash. \u003cbr\u003eJust like sleeping with your makeup on, forgetting to remove your sunscreen can clog your pores, lead to breakouts, and cause skin irritation.\u003cbr\u003eEven if you’re not planning to wear makeup or spend time outdoors, you should be wearing an SPF every day. Sitting by your window is enough for the UV rays to reach your skin. Protect yourself from the risk of skin cancer and prevent premature aging by taking 30 seconds out of your day to apply sunscreen. Trust us. You’ll thank yourself later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

You can swap out Rosie’s Birkin bag for your favourite oversized tote.

We’re here to tell you that your dress size is only a number. This summer, we want you to look and feel amazing in your body. \u003cbr\u003eSummer is a time of garden parties, trips to the beach, road trips, afternoon tea, and al fresco dining. It’s probably the one time of year where you will end up doing multiple outfit changes during the day – and that’s before you even think of the heat! Getting your closet ready for the summer months can be tricky, but trust us, your Instagram feed will thank you!\u003cbr\u003eYou should be enjoying summer and the all the fun that comes with it just as much as everyone else.

We love this look by Mikayla that incorporates a mini dress with an oversized leather jacket. You can show off your summer tan while staying warm against the summer breeze. Accessorising your shoes to match the leather jacket helps tie the look together. \u003cbr\u003eEven if you live in a tropical climate, it’s worth keeping a leather jacket at the front of your summer closet to throw over your shoulder on night’s out or if you’re not sure how the day will pan out. You can wear this outfit from day to night, just by adding the leather jacket on top.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFigure-Hugging Dress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can guarantee that you’ll end up on at least one dance floor this summer. A \u0026nbsp;figure-hugging dress is something that every woman should own. Choose one in your favourite colour and pick a silhouette that works with your body shape and silhouette. Midi dresses and slip dresses are a go-to choice for summer, but don’t be afraid to go with a shorter figure-hugging dress.\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose your dress in one of the trending colours of the season – magenta pink, acid green, mellow yellow, or bubblegum pink.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMatching Knitwear\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou might think that knitwear is a winter-only staple, but you can rock this closet staple all year long. Nothing is cuter than a matching knitwear set, which can keep an outfit casual if you’re heading out for drinks with friends or splurging on some al fresco dining. \u003cbr\u003eYou can make your matching knitwear set summer appropriate by choosing a crop top style like the one Julia is wearing in our inspiration picture. It’s also worth keeping an eye out for cotton and other breathable fabrics that will keep you cool throughout the summer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLadylike neutrals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSummer is a time of garden parties, trips to hotels, and more than a few meals out with friends. You can never go wrong with a tonal look during the summer. We love this neutral look that Thamarr is wearing, with different hues of beige and white playing off each other for an elevated look. The straw hat gives her look a summery twist, along with the open-toe strappy sandals.\u003cbr\u003eOne of our favourite pro-tips for wearing dresses during the summer is to wear bicycle shorts underneath to stop your thighs rubbing against each other. This tip works best if you have a longer skirt and a shorter pair of bicycle shorts to hide them under the skirt. If not, you can add a coat of baby powder to your legs to help stop the friction between your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLaidback Sporty Chic\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking for plus size fashion inspiration, Ashley Graham will be your new style muse. She’s our go-to choice for outfit inspo, and her body positivity is infectious. We love this sporty chic look that is perfect for a BBQ, day out with friends, or a trip to the beach.\u003cbr\u003eAshley’s outfit features pieces from the Hugo Boss x Russell Athletic collection, but you are almost guaranteed to have similar pieces already in your closet. It’s worth taking a tip from Ashley Graham and shopping in the men’s section for pieces like these as you’ll often get a nicer fit and may even be able to grab them on sale. \u003cbr\u003eWho said we couldn’t make preppy chic?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eActivewear meets Business\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of activewear, we’re not ready to give up our comfortable sports bras and bicycle shorts just yet. If you’ve got a business casual event or if you’re heading to a restaurant that requires a jacket, this is the perfect solution. We love how Carla Ortiz has kept the classic activewear look of a sports bra with knitted cycling shorts, while elevating her look by throwing a blazer on top.\u003cbr\u003eYou can finish off your look with your favourite white sneakers and add a small mini bag to elevate your look. Make the outfit even more summer appropriate by throwing your hair back into a high ponytail or a bun to keep it out of your face. Don’t forget to layer up your jewellery to add a feminine feel.\u003cbr\u003eEven though we’re going back into the real world, it’s not time to say goodbye to our activewear just yet. During the summer, you want to be comfortable in your clothes – meaning that activewear is your BFF. Does anyone want to wear a wired bra when the temperatures start to rise? We’ll stick with a sports bra.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBridgerton Inspired\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one thing that we all love, it’s a romantic dress. The summer season naturally has a romantic feeling in the air, between weddings, engagements, and the bloom of new flowers. \u0026nbsp;Embrace the season by treating yourself to a regency inspired full-length smock dress. We love this white and blue floral dress that Ana Rivera is wearing. It gives us serious Belle vibes and would be perfect for any event in your social calendar.\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of these midi-dresses is that you can do anything in them; whether it’s having a quick nap or going for a walk on the beach. You can take your dress from day to night by swapping your sandals for open-toe mules or your favourite stilettoes. If you want to keep it casual, you can wear flip flops or sneakers. \u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re choosing a fuller dress, it’s a good idea to choose one that covers your shoulder. The last thing you want to worry about is your shoulders getting sunburnt while you’re relaxing outside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBold Shades \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSummer is the time of year when we tend to have a fully-packed social calendar. Between weddings, engagement parties, birthdays, and ‘just because’ events. You can guarantee that you’ll need at least one special occasion outfit to see you through the summer. We love that Nicole Campbell went outside the box with a monochromatic look in one of the trending colours of the season.\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to take centre stage with a bold colour to make a statement. Nicole’s two piece outfit also incorporates an illusion of the on-trend cut-out silhouette.\u003cbr\u003eOther colours that you want to consider for summer 2021 include sage green, acid green, pastel pink, mellow yellow, and magenta purple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eJeans and a crop top\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhether you’ve got a date night or are going out for drinks with friends, one of our favourite summer looks is a casual jean and crop top combo. This outfit is casual and chic, making it perfect to wear throughout the summer. If you’re looking to recreate this style, it’s best to choose a shirt in a silk fabric to keep your cool and give your outfit an elevated feel.\u003cbr\u003eFor the summer, you want to avoid wearing darker colours of denim as it will attract the sun and make it difficult to keep yourself cool. White denim is your BFF if you want to wear your favourite jeans during the summer months. They’re also perfect for wearing with a crop top that has a pop of colour to shake up your look.\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to jeans, it’s a good idea to stay away from skinny jeans as that can make you feel warmer and make it harder to keep your temperature cool. Straight legged and boyfriend-fit jeans are the perfect choice for summer. You can finish this outfit off with any shoes of your choice – whether you prefer mules or leather flats.\u003cbr\u003eWith summer just around the corner, it’s time to remember that you can wear whatever you want. Regardless of what your dress size is, you can wear a crop top or a bikini. Trust us.

Whether you have a square, heart, or a round face, there is a style out there that will work for you. It may take some trial and error, but you’re guaranteed to find your perfect match\u003cbr\u003ePretty much the entire population suits a fringe – but it’s all about how it frames your face and where it ends. It’s important to stop and think about how a fringe changes the illusion of your face. If you have a longer fringe, it can accentuate your cheekbones or skim your eyebrows and make them look virtually invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re choosing your bangs, the most important thing to do is to stop and consider your face shape and the jaw line that you have. \u003cbr\u003eThe go-to fringe style for 2021 is the classic style of a cropped and chopped fringe. It’s true that fringes generally work best with longer hair, but they’re also the perfect match for a long bob or even a pixie cut. When choosing your fringe, you want to stop and consider where it sits on your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat will make or break your fringe is where it sits on your forehead. You either want to place it halfway across your forehead at your brow bone or keep it shorter in the centre and keep the sides longer by a few centimetres. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen in doubt, the best thing to do is to look for some celebrity inspiration. Find someone who has the same face shape and a similar bone structure to your face. You can then use their different hair styles and fringes as a point of reference to help you find a style that will flatter your own face. If you’re still struggling to decide, your hair stylist is usually the best person to turn to for advice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOur guide goes through some of the most popular hairstyles with bangs to give you inspiration for your next \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/why-everyone-is-talking-about-the-wolf-haircut-on-tiktok\"\u003ehaircut.\u003c/a\u003e This guide is packed full of ten celebrity inspiration photos, so it’s worth bookmarking this page and coming back when you’re getting ready for your next haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFeathered cheekbone fringe and shag haircut\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one person who can rock any hairstyle, it’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CSJiBAKrOc9/\"\u003eElizabeth Olsen\u003c/a\u003e. The actress has changed up her hairstyle various times for different film roles and in real life. Her new brunette bangs made an appearance during a virtual event for Marvel’s ‘The Falcon and the Winter Solider’ series. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eElizabeth’s complemented her tousled shag haircut with 70s inspired curtain bangs that are feathered down to her cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBun and French girl fringe\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne classic low-maintenance option hat you don’t want to sleep on is a bun and a French girl fringe. \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gigihadid/\"\u003eGigi Hadid \u003c/a\u003erecently shared a photo on Instagram captioned ‘fresh snow, fresh cut’ as the mum of one unveiled her new hair. The French-girl fringe is a thick and full fringe that skims your eyebrows. If you’re someone who is always wearing their hair in a high ponytail or bun, then this style is a classic choice for you to try.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFeathery fringe and long longs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile Kendall didn’t seem a fan of her feathered fringe, we think it’s a great example of how drastically your fringe can change your look. Just by adding a feathered fringe, Kendall suddenly looked a lot more like her mum Kris and older half-sister Kim Kardashian-West. Although this style didn’t work for Kendall, it’s a style that suits her face shape and is a classic choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBlunt block bangs and straight bob\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNothing screams supermodel more than a straight bob with a blunt block fringe. If you’re blessed to have the same bone structure as Bella Hadid, then this is the hairstyle that you need to try. \u003cbr\u003eThe one thing you want to consider with a block fringe is how quickly your hair grows. You might find yourself heading back to the salon more often or cutting your fringe at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe 70s shaggy fringe and boho curls\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to bohemian romanticism, the 70s shaggy fringe is king. If you want to inject a little boho chic to your look, take a leaf out of JLo’s book and experiment with some extra long curls and a messy fringe. \u003cbr\u003eDepending on your face shape, you can feather your fringe down to your cheekbones or leave them shorter to work with your bone structure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFull bangs with straight hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAre you ready to channel your inner superhero? Kim Kardashian switched up her look for a Valentine’s Day shoot for KKW Beauty. Her full fringe and straight bangs gave the reality TV star a 60s inspired look and turned her into an epic superhero (or villain!). The super straight hair creates a seamless look between Kim’s mid-lengths and fringe. If you’re someone who is prepared to deal with the upkeep of a full fringe, this still might be right up your street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFrench girl fringe and curly waves\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIs there anything more Parisian than Priyanka Chopra’s hair style? We love that she opted for the easy-to-maintain French girl fringe that frames her face without being too overwhelming. The tousled curls and wavy hair add a feminine feel to the look that deliberately appears natural instead of picture perfect. If you’re trying this look at home, it’s worth brushing through your curls to help loosen them or to use a straightener instead of a curling wand for more wavy curls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCurly Bangs and a long bob\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSelena Gomez can do no wrong when it comes to hairstyles. The singer and actress is currently rocking a curly look inspired by the 1970s flower power look. If you have curly hair, you’ll love this retro-inspired look. The secret to recreating Selena’s style is to keep shorter locks of hair around your face to help enhance and define the shape of your natural curls. The same advice applies if you’re curling your hair with a wand or other hot tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest hair trends right now is texture and embracing your natural hair, with Selena’s look being a classic example of that. You can also see flashes of blonde through her curls, showing the natural glow that comes from a balayage treatment. If you’re thinking of going with a full curly look, it’s worth considering adding a balayage or highlight treatment to your hair to give your curls a lift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTapered curtain bangs and long curls\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe couldn’t help but share another hair style from Priyanka Chopra – especially as it seems to be the hairstyle of 2021. Her long and tapered fringe is an example of how you can add volume and length into your curtain bangs. If you’re not a fan of styling your bangs every day, the long and tapered style requires no maintenance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe benefit of this style is that you can let it grow or put it to the sides of your face once it gets too long. As they’re your natural bags, you don’t need to worry about straightening them. If you want to keep your curtain bangs looking fresh with this style, it’s a good idea to have them re-cut every two to three weeks depending on your hair growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMicro fringe and baby ponytail\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBella Hadid is infamous for bringing old styles back into fashion. Baby and micro bangs are making a serious comeback this year, which isn’t surprising when you see Bella Hadid rocking the style. If you’re thinking of going with a shorter fringe, it’s good to know that this style generally is better suited to those with a slimmer and oval face shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile other fringes can hide your features, a micro fringe is so shot that it hides nothing at all. It’s also worth remembering that a micro fringe needs a little extra TLC as it will generally be greasier than a normal fringe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat we love about bangs being back in stye is that we don’t have to wait until a breakup or nervous breakdown to change up our look. If you want to change your style without doing anything drastic to the length or colour, a fringe is always your best option. You can give your look an upgrade without feeling the need to chop off half your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re choosing your fringe style, it’s a good idea to stop and think of which style fits your lifestyle. Do you have the time to style your fringe every day? Are you prepared to wash your hair more for a micro-fringe? Just like anything, these bangs come with pros and cons. The most important thing to remember is that you need a fringe that works with your face shape. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these hairstyles will you be trying out?

Consumers can have complete peace of mind before going through with the purchase on a livestream. \u003cbr\u003ePlus, coupled with influencer marketing, livestream shopping can work like a miracle for brands. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eIn this article, we talk about the successful use of livestream shopping by Chinese influencers and its effects on the rest of the eCommerce world. \u003cbr\u003eLet’s dig in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChinese Livestream Shopping Giants\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt might not be news now that the Chinese eCommerce industry has been on the rise and the pandemic has given it a push forward.\u003cbr\u003eA study suggests that China has the highest level of retail sales in the world. And, most of it can be justifiably tied to live commerce. \u003cbr\u003eThe eCommerce giant Alibaba’s Taobao enjoys the largest share of 80% in live commerce. And, other Chinese eCommerce companies like Baidu and JD.com aren’t far behind either. \u003cbr\u003eLivestream shopping platforms like Taobao have been successful at connecting shoppers and brands. It has not only been selling at a massive scale to consumers but also is a source of entertainment for the masses. Something that other eCommerce platforms might want to replicate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChinese Livestream Influencers Getting Celebrity Status\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInfluencer marketing has already been growing at a pace comparable to any other marketing strategy. What that means is that influencers are gaining popularity in their respective industries. \u003cbr\u003eBut, influencer marketing isn’t limited to social media platforms. Chinese Ecommerce heavyweights like Taobao have proven that by using influencers to sell a historic number of products on livestreams. \u003cbr\u003eEcommerce livestreaming has elevated influencers to celebrity status, especially in China. They are thought of as key opinion leaders and are being paid generously as well. \u003cbr\u003eKOLs in China receive a hefty sum of commissions on the products sold through their livestreams in addition to an appearance fee. \u003cbr\u003eThat said, as more and more people jump on the bandwagon of influencer marketing, there are a lot of relatively inexpensive options in virtually every industry. \u003cbr\u003eAs a brand, you just need to look at the right place with the right strategy. Plus, you can strike up a deal where most of your expenditure goes from the products sold. This would be a win-win for both parties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Growth of Livestream Influencers in the Smaller Sector \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile influencers that gained celebrity-like status in China have been quite impactful for brands, the trend seems to shift to smaller markets as well. \u003cbr\u003eThis can be encouraging for brands that can’t afford to invest a hefty sum of their marketing budget on a heavyweight influencer. \u003cbr\u003eNiche influencers with a specialty in their own industry are gaining popularity not in China but also in the western eCommerce landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Impact of Chinese Live Commerce Success\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs digital media continue to be more relevant in the lives of a consumer, convenience will continue to find its way into their lives. \u003cbr\u003eWe’ve seen that how eCommerce has been taking the place of a brick-and-mortar retail store in the last few years. \u003cbr\u003eThe changing retail landscape experienced a boost when the crisis hit in the form of a pandemic. It affected everyone and limited human-to-human interaction on a massive scale. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, some might say that eCommerce has been a saving grace for many consumers that didn’t have the option to leave their homes. \u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, China has been pretty active at using livestream commerce even before the pandemic hit. And, again, the crisis has only given it a push forward. \u003cbr\u003eEven before the crisis, by March 2020, Chinese live commerce users were 265 million. This was more than 29% of the country’s overall internet users. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, lockdown situations in China boosted the live commerce industry. You’d see Chinese brands doing livestreams weekly or even daily. \u003cbr\u003eSeeing the success Chinese eCommerce platforms like Taobao had, many other digital giants like Amazon and Facebook jumped on the bandwagon. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eIn 2019, the US eCommerce heavyweight also announced its own livestream platform “Amazon Live”. It allows brands and influencers to work together and present their products directly to prospects. \u003cbr\u003eNot to mention the social media giant Facebook, which now also owns Instagram, jumping on the bandwagon of livestream shopping. \u003cbr\u003eBut, is there still room for improvement for the western eCommerce industry? Let’s see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat the West Can Learn?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eClearly, the west needs to catch up as far as eCommerce livestreaming is concerned. It still trails China in the “livestreaming for selling” industry.\u003cbr\u003eA prominent factor that renders Chinese companies more effective at utilizing live commerce is the less fragmentation in eCommerce. \u003cbr\u003eWhile Amazon and eBay are major players in the worldwide eCommerce phenomenon, the US still lacks in this sector. \u003cbr\u003eAmazon accounted for 37% of the eCommerce in the US in 2019 while eBay had a share of 6.1% of the market. Beyond that, the picture is not that bright. \u003cbr\u003eAlmost everything else in the online retail industry relies on individual websites. It’s a fragmented market and consumers need to explore a variety of websites from different sellers to find what they want. \u003cbr\u003eIn contrast, you’d find a lot of integration in China. The country’s 2 eCommerce companies, Alibaba and JD.com account for about 72% of the overall market share.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCreating Livestream-specific Talent\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eChina has also been producing skillful hosts that know how to maneuver livestreams. They know the art of engaging the audience while also selling products effectively. Something that’s probably lacking in the western livestream influencer industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBuilding Cross-functional Platforms\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDid you know that Google tried to move into the social media arena and Facebook took its shot at eCommerce?\u003cbr\u003eWell, both initiatives didn’t go quite as planned. While both are extremely successful in their own category, they haven’t been able to capture other markets as effectively up until now. \u003cbr\u003eThe audiences in the west see these platforms belonging to completely different categories and aren’t really ready to accept the cross-functionality. \u003cbr\u003eIn contrast, Chinese eCommerce industry leaders like Alibaba have been able to move into categories other than eCommerce as well. \u003cbr\u003eFor instance, Taobao, a livestream shopping platform where hosts don’t only sell products but also deliver great content to consumers.\u003cbr\u003eAlibaba has also integrated its own payment solution “Alipay” into the mainstream. Moreover, WeChat is another example of how the masses can use a single platform for multiple purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat Should You Do as a Brand?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSo, as a brand, what can you learn from the success of Chinese influencer Livestreaming? For one, you should consider starting livestream shopping if you haven’t yet. \u003cbr\u003eSecond, as a brand, you need to look into the ways you can use livestream influencers to grow your brand. \u003cbr\u003eSee, influencers don’t only know the craft of creating engaging content, but they are also great at communication. \u003cbr\u003ePlus, if your business is new, you could use an already established audience by working with a seasoned influencer in your industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFinding the Right Influencers for Your Livestreams\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe next step after you realize that influencer livestreaming can help you get more customers is creating your strategy and finding influencers. \u003cbr\u003eBut, any influencer won’t do. You would need to find out the one that can not only engage your audience but make them act on your offers as well. \u003cbr\u003eFirst, find the platforms where you think your target audience might be hanging out. See if you can find some influencers that have a decent engagement rate on their content. \u003cbr\u003eThe most important factors while considering an influencer for your livestreams are:\u003cbr\u003e•\tThe industry \u003cbr\u003e•\tThe audience size\u003cbr\u003e•\tThe engagement rate\u003cbr\u003eOnce you have a small list of influencers, you can then pitch your offer to them. Making sure that you offer them something first can substantially increase your chances of getting a reply. \u003cbr\u003eMost influencers are great at engaging and selling to the online audience. You may even not have to provide a content outline for your livestream. \u003cbr\u003eIf all goes well, you can form a long-term partnership with them so that you don’t have to look for new influencers for your future streams. \u003cbr\u003eThe massive success that the Chinese livestream influencers had tells us a lot about influencer marketing’s potential. \u003cbr\u003eBesides the right influencer, probably the second most important thing you need to carry out impactful livestreams is dedicated livestream software. \u003cbr\u003eWe are excited to tell you that now you can do livestreams with full control and ease with Jumble’s own livestream software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStart your live commerce journey as are tail brand from \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eSummer is right around the corner. It’s the time of year when we’re all thinking of how our body look. We’ve all heard the saying ‘summer body’ and ‘suns out, guns out’. \u0026nbsp;While that might make you think of your arms, it’s usually our legs that we’re most conscious about. Most of the year, our legs are covered by jeans or tights. Once the temperatures start to rise, it’s shorts and skirt season. \u003cbr\u003eDuring the summer, you want to look and feel amazing. You can get your legs summer-ready by helping to lift and tone what you already have. It’s all about smoothing and defining your legs. We’re sharing our top tips on how to get your legs ready for summer 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eToning your legs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you asked a personal trainer what the most common question that they get is, most of them will tell you that it’s about how you can get your legs ready for shorts season. The secret to toning your legs – or anywhere on your body – is to reduce your body fat, while maintaining the lean tissue. \u003cbr\u003eWhat you need to do to lose weight is to be in a calorie deficit. You only need a small (and sustainable!) calorie deficit to start to see a difference. Alongside your diet, you want to be incorporating training to preserve the leaner tissue. Diet and exercise go hand-in-hand to give you that toned look that everyone is trying to achieve,\u003cbr\u003eYou want to start by incorporating lower body workouts that focus on movements in every direction to engage all of your major muscle groups. You need to be activating everything from your adductors in your thighs to your quadriceps in the front of your leg, and the hamstrings.\u003cbr\u003eBefore you think of heading to the gym and doing nothing but lunges and squats, take a step back. You don’t want to be focusing solely on what you can see in the mirror. Focusing too much on squats can end up causing lower back and knee issues. You need to be working out the back of your legs as much as the front, otherwise you’ll have an imbalanced look. Most fitness trainers spend twice as long training the back of your leg as the front.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re someone who wears high heels, you want to be focusing on boosting the balance between your hamstrings and quadriceps. When you’re standing in heels for long periods, it pushes your centre of gravity forwards, which means that your quadriceps are doing most of the work to keep your body straight and upright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYour starter leg workout\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re coming up with your fitness routine or workout plans, you want to be training your legs three times a week with two low-intensity cardio sessions added in. \u003cbr\u003eHere’s an example of a sample workout that you can do:\u003cbr\u003e•\t3x 6-8 reps of goblet squats\u003cbr\u003e•\t4x 10-12 reps of sliders/hamstring curls\u003cbr\u003e•\t3x 8 reps of step ups \u003cbr\u003e•\t3x 12 reps of hamstring bridges\u003cbr\u003eIt’s never too early or too late to start your fitness journey. If you’re looking to get your dream summer body, it’s usually a god idea to start right away. You won’t lose weight or tone-up overnight, so it’s always better to start now than wait until the time is ‘right’. Summer starts earlier and lasts longer than ever, meaning you want to start and keep up your summer workout routine for longer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to define your legs without doing exercise\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not just exercise that you want to be focusing on. Toning your leg is as much about adding definition as it is about exercising. While you want to be incorporating toning exercises, there’s plenty of other steps that you can take to boost the tone and definition of your legs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAdd a healthy glow with a body oil\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBody oils are a staple of the summer to give your skin a dewy glow. The Sunday Fridays Pool Time Glowing Body Oil is being raved about as the must-have for summer. It leaves a healthy sheen on your skin, making you look and feel more confident. What we love about using a body oil is that it adds an extra layer of fragrance to your skin. The Sunday Fridays body oil has a sweet vanilla, coconut, and warm almond scent that lingers on your skin. It’s sweet enough to eat!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHydrate your skin\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t forget about hydrating your skin! During the summer, you want to make sure you’re boosting your water intake – both for your body and skin. We all know the importance of using a body moisturizer, but it takes on a whole new importance during the summer. No one wants flaky or dry skin during the summer.\u003cbr\u003eAdd a lightweight and silky body moisturizer to your routine to deeply hydrate your skin and help it maintain its elasticity. Our top choice is the Black Rose Beautifying Emulsion moisturizer by Sisley, powered by black rose, camelina oil, and white ginger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTan from a bottle\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe all know that it isn’t safe to get your tan from the sun or a sunbed. It’s always safer for your skin to indulge in a fake tan than a genuine one. When you find a fake tan that you love and that gives you a golden glow, then you’re set for life. \u003cbr\u003eOne of the most popular fake tans is the Isle of Paradise’s new Self-Tanning Butter which hydrates your skin and is beginner friendly. The Glow 20 Tan Mousse by James Read is our go-to choice when we need a last minute fake tan as it starts to show a subtle glow within 20 minutes, giving you deeper results within 90 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTone with a body cream\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eHear us out. While a body cream alone isn’t enough to tone your legs and get them summer ready, it can be a gamechanger to how your legs look. You want to choose a body cream that nourishes your skin and gives you a natural shine. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking to make a splurge purchase, the Restoring Toning Body Cream by Susanne Kaufmann is a must-have. It contains an innovative formula with boldo, caffeine, and tiger grass that boosts the metabolism of your skin and supports your collagen production. Using this product consistently will help to plump your skin to give you a toned and healthy look. It also contains jiagoulan plant that helps fortify your skin’s protective barrier to smooth your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStreamline and give a lengthening illusion\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s anyone who is our inspiration for a summer body, it’s Rihanna. She’s the queen of a glowing tan and has mastered the art of body tints to help streamline your body and give the illusion of slimmer legs. The Body Sauce Body Luminizing Tint\u003cbr\u003e by Fenty Beauty is our go-to this summer. All you need to do is roll the transfer-resistant formula over your legs to give you a natural-looking tan and a subtle shimmer that leaves an airbrush effect on your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDepuff your legs\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJust like your under eyes, you want to depuff your legs. As the temperatures start to rise, it’s not unusual for your limbs to start to swell up. You want to use a serum for your legs to help depuff your limbs. \u003cbr\u003eOur top choice is the Legs Eleven Cooling Leg Serum by Bloom and Blossom. It’s packed full of peppermint leaf oil for a refreshing effect, while the aloe vera works to soothe and hydrate your skin. You can massage it into your legs to help promote your lymphatic drainage, de-puff your skin, and boost your circulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDon’t forget about exfoliating!\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one secret to summer-ready legs, it’s exfoliating. Before you can even think of adding fake tan and using a moisturizer, you need to remove the dead skin cells from your skin. You won’t be able to get a natural-looking and even coverage with your fake tan unless you’ve exfoliated first.\u003cbr\u003eChoose a body scrub with sea salt and use it on damp skin before showering as a way of prepping your body before applying your fake tan. If you want to save time, find an exfoliator that also includes oil so that you can buff away the dead skin cells, while also hydrating your skin. You can exfoliate during your morning routine and then apply your fake tan later in the day.\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of fake tan, you need to moisturize your body before applying your fake tan. At a minimum, you want to add moisturizer to anywhere on your body with dry patches, especially your ankles, elbows, palms, and knees. During the summer, it’s a good idea to moisturize your legs twice a day. With hundreds of body lotions and creams on the market, you’re guaranteed to find one that works for you and your body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIndulge in a pedicure\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNo look is every complete without a fresh coat of nail polish. The summer brings with it open-toe shoes and flip-flops. Take the time to indulge in a pedicure or give yourself an at-home nail treatment. Don’t forget to add a moisturizer to your feet to give them a natural shine and to keep them hydrated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow are you getting your legs summer-ready?

While it’ll take most of us a while to wrap our head around the idea, we’re here to help you understand it. NFTs are a form of cryptocurrency blockchain and is a digital asset. What makes the NFT non-fungible is that it is irreplaceable. It’s a one-off, original, and exclusive item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the course of the pandemic, NFTs have taken on a whole new life. They’re appearing in every sector, whether it’s literature, music, or photography, with art being the most common type of NFT. Everyone from influencers to high-profile celebrities are tipping their toes into the world of cryptocurrency, including the infamous NFTs. They’re not just buying NFTs, they’re selling them.\u003cbr\u003eEmily Ratajkowski has been auctioning a virtual essay that she’s written for The Cut and fellow supermodel Kate Moss is selling several videos of herself doing everyday things like sleeping and driving. They’re not the first celebrities to try and make a pretty penny from NFTs. Actress and entrepreneur Lindsay Lohan sold a portrait of herself as an NFT for more than $50,000. \u003cbr\u003eIf you want a more extreme example of how much an NFT can make, look no further than Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. He sold his first-ever tweet for almost $3 million. It was bought by Sina Estavi, a CEO of a Malaysian-based blockchain service. He compared the tweet to a modern-day version of the Mona Lisa.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you think of all these celebrities getting on board, it’s no surprise that NFT sales have bounced by 2000% between 2020-2021. If you’re able to get your foot into the NFT business, you can make a pretty penny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRecent NFT Sales\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSome of the recent NFT sales give you an insight into the interesting world of NFTs and what is making the top-ticket price.\u003cbr\u003eDo you remember the iconic ‘Charlie Bit My Finger’ video? It was one of the first YouTube videos to go viral, featuring Charlie biting the finger of his older brother, Harry. It was auctioned off by their family and earned almost £540,000. Now that the video has been sold, it will be removed from YouTube. The Charlie video is an interesting example, as the video is widely available elsewhere online.\u003cbr\u003eOn the fashion side, the Parisian luxury accessory store, Labodet, has unveiled its first NFT in the form of a mobile phone wallpaper. The original item behind the wallpaper was handcrafted by a specialist artisan using exotic crocodile leather and features 18k gold that is satin-brushed onto the fabric.\u003cbr\u003eAt another end of the spectrum, we have a more poignant example of NFTs. Khaled Jarrar is selling solid from the Palestinian city of Ramallah, located in the central West Bank. His work is entitled, ‘If I don’t steal your home, someone else will steal it’. The title is a reclaiming of the phrase used by an Israeli settle when they were evicting Palestinian families the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. Khaled Jarrar chose to offer his work as an NFT due to the public attention on the industry and to bring awareness to the issues citizens face in Palestine.\u003cbr\u003eThe art industry remains the most popular niche within the NFT sector. The famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence has just sold a Michelangelo NFT for almost £120,000. The painting, the Tondo Doni, is one of the prized pieces from the gallery’s Michelangelo collection, and focuses on the holy family. The painting dates back to 1506 and is an example of heritage art being brought into a contemporary setting. The Uffizi Gallery is planning to sell other works from their collection as NFT, including the famous Birth of Venus painting by Botticelli.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not just art that has found its way into the NFT market. FC Dynamo Kyiv, the top team in the Ukranian Premier League, has started selling NFT tickets for their 2021 season. This new style of ticket will be launching at the end of the month and is part of the brand’s strategy to become the ‘greatest technological leader of football within the next two years’.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLuxury Brands and NFTs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLuxury fashion brands are currently debating whether they want to take the plunge into the world of NFTs. While they are all the rage right now, fashion brands don’t want to attach themselves to a momentary phase. Are the millennials who are obsessed with crypto-currency interested in purchasing the NFTs from luxury fashion brands? Would it dilute the value of the brand? How complicated would it be to set up NFTs alongside brand’s existing products?\u003cbr\u003eEverywhere we look, there are stories of record-breaking NFT sales, some of which we’ve featured in this article. While the art world is awake to the sound of NFTs, the luxury fashion industry is still making its mind up about NFTs.\u003cbr\u003eGucci have told Vogue Business that it is “only a matter of time” before brands within their niche release their first NFT. The publication claims to have been told my multiple sources that there are numerous luxury fashion brands who are planning to release NFTs in the near future. The question around NFTs and the luxury fashion industry is who will be the first person to bring one to the market.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s a well-known fact that luxury brands are on the back-foot with the e-commerce industry, but it’s clear that they are becoming more willing to embrace the world of NFTs and blockchain technology.\u003cbr\u003eThe fashion industry is full of conversations around the possible incorporation of NFTs with the luxury fashion niche. Some commentators see NFTs as the natural evolution within the digital fashion industry, especially as digital fashion skins have already been embraced by luxury brands. What makes NFTs appealing to luxury fashion industries is that their scarcity and rarity brings their value closer to that of a physical luxury item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCreating a NFT hub for fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor now, the fashion that is being sold through NFT is art instead of actual fashion. More utility will eventually come into the niche, but for now, it’s clear that the industry is more focused on art NFTs than fashion items. Part of what puts the fashion industry off NFT is that they are not functional. What can an owner do other than look at it? An NFT is not like a Birkin bag that you can carry around with you. \u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that the NFT industry doesn’t meet the expectations of luxury shoppers and fails to match the in-store experience or even that of ordering online. The virtual game Decentraland and its fashion NFTs shows that for now, NFTs are a world away from that of luxury fashion. The NFTs that you’ll find focus primarily on sneakers, hoodies, and costumes. Everything is pixelated and has a cartoon-style finish.\u003cbr\u003eThe Decentraland game also showcases another problem that the industry faces. Setting up your browser-based Ethereum wallet is not something that is likely to appeal to people who buy from brands like Chanel, Dior, or Hermes.\u003cbr\u003eThe solution to these problems is to create a system and experience that gives the audience a luxury experience. The industry doesn’t need another Amazon style set-up, but something closer to MyTheresa or Net-a-Porter.\u003cbr\u003eWe’re already seeing start-ups arriving on the market to try and capitalise on this need. Neuno, a Syndey-based start-up, is rumoured to be working with five different luxury fashion brands to help them launch their NFTs. The company’s CEO, Natalie Johnson, has told Vogue Business that they want to create a “universal 3D wardrobe that plugs into everything”. Part of their work includes utilizing social media filters to allow the owners of fashion NFTs to post images of themselves wearing the item they have bought. This technology would also include being able to use the NFT as clothes for gaming avatars.\u003cbr\u003eThe current set-up of NFTs allow anyone to upload and sell an NFT on the market. What Neuno hopes to achieve is to work directly with brands to create a premium and luxury experience for audiences, giving consumers the assurance that the items are authentic and backed by the brand. This start-up also aims to streamline the process by allowing consumers to purchase NFTs using their credit card, so that there is no need to have cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExisting NFT marketplaces\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s worth knowing that there are already some fashion NFTs companies out there that work as marketplaces. Currency websites include KnownOrigin, OpenSea, and Nifty Gateway. Clothia is an online retailer that offers fashion NFTs as a digital ‘twin’ of an existing and physical garment. Clothia operates by giving winning bids both the physical garment and NFTs of a one-of-a-kind item.\u003cbr\u003eClothia’s CEO, Elena Silenok, told Vogue that luxury fashion houses should think of NFTs as an additional revenue stream and a way of digitalising their existing product range. NFTs are a way of making brand’s more accessible, just like a Dior lipstick is more accessible for the average person than a Lady Dior bag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of fashion NFTs?

In reality, it’s your SPF that needs to be your daily go-to. The number one tip that every dermatologist will give you is that you should be wearing a daily SPF to protect your skin. Regardless of its formula, a sunscreen will protect your skin from sun damage and the threat of premature aging. \u003cbr\u003eSunscreens can be divided into two types of formulas – chemical and minerals. What are the differences and why does that matter? We’re taking a deep dive into chemical and mineral sunscreens to help you decide which one is your perfect match.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUsing a daily SPF\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to use a chemical, mineral, or hybrid sunscreen formula, the most important thing is to be consistent. It’s not enough to just be using a sunscreen when the sun is out. You want to be using it every day. The golden rule has always been that the ‘best’ sunscreen is the one that you’re wearing every day. \u003cbr\u003eThe secret to protecting your skin and keeping it youthful is to find a sunscreen that you enjoy using and can be consistent with. As long as your sunscreen has an SPF of at least 30, you’re good to go!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy you need a daily SPF\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not just skin cancer that your sunscreen prevents. UV rays can wreak havoc on your skin and cause a myriad of problems that can be difficult to tackle. Everything from hyperpigmentation to fine lines and scarring can be caused by exposure to UV rays. Continued exposure to UV rays means that your skin is more likely to experiment premature aging, including wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’ve invested in your skincare routine, you need to be using a sunscreen to make it all worthwhile. Whatever your skincare routine is like – whether you’re a skinimalist or have a 20-step routine – your SPF is a non-negotiable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChoosing your SPF\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFinding an SPF is easier than finding your perfect lipstick shade. Yes, the formulas can be complicated to understand, but there are only three main types to choose from. Over time, sunscreen formulas have become more innovative and inclusive. Gone are the days when mineral foundations automatically gave you an ashy or chalky cast to your skin. For years, mineral sunscreens were seen as the essential choice for those with sensitive skin.\u003cbr\u003eAs the skincare industry evolves and becomes smarter, sunscreens have undergone the same change. Mineral sunscreens have grown to become more inclusive by incorporating zinc nanoparticles, meaning that they work for a spectrum of complexions. \u003cbr\u003eWe won’t be surprised when the day comes that the “best sunscreen is the one you’re going to wear” argument dies a quick death. As these formulas become smarter, there will be a time that you find the best sunscreen for you and your skin.\u003cbr\u003eEverything from the environmental impact of mineral nanoparticles to the research involving oxybenzone and octinoxate will impact which formulas are the best to use on your skin. The production of sunscreen has been shown to have a negative impact on our coral and marine life. As we all become more conscious of our environmental footprint, these sunscreen formulas will likely evolve to become more environmentally friendly and to incorporate ‘green’ beauty into their production.\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be shocked if we start to see ‘all-natural’ and ‘reef-safe’ sunscreens starting to hit the market in the next few years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEverything you need to know about mineral sunscreens\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the two most popular types of sunscreens are those with a mineral formula. These sunscreens are also known as ‘physical’ sunscreen as they contain inorganic ingredients, including titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. \u003cbr\u003eA benefit of mineral sunscreens is that their physical ‘reflective’ nature of sun protection means that you don’t have to wait the usual 15-minutes for it to take effect. It’s an ideal type of sunscreen to keep in your bag to reapply while sitting in the sun or at your office desk. \u003cbr\u003eWhat makes mineral sunscreens so popular is that they are photostable, meaning you don’t need to worry about reapplying them as frequently. \u0026nbsp;You can go longer between touch-ups than with your chemical sunscreens. \u003cbr\u003eAll physical sunscreens are able to reflect and scatter around 5-10% of UV rays, whereas chemical filters scatter more incoming rays. If you’re looking for a physical sunscreen, keep an eye out for those that use titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as they can block a wider range of UV wavelengths, while also being photostable. \u003cbr\u003eDermatologists continue to recommend mineral sunscreens for those with sensitive skin. While only a small number of people are likely to be allergic to chemical sunscreens, it’s usually best to stick to mineral formulas if you know your skin has sensitivity. \u003cbr\u003eAnother benefit of this physical sunscreen is that they are less likely to clog your pores or cause irritation. If you can find a mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide in its formula, you can take advantage of its anti-inflammatory properties to help soothe your skin and reduce redness.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’ve had a bad experience with mineral sunscreens in the past, it might be due to the appearance and texture of your product. It’s worth remembering that physical sunscreens act by sitting on the surface of your skin to block UV rays. If you’re looking for an invisible application, it’ll take a little more work to get your skin to fully absorb your sunscreen.\u003cbr\u003eOnly a few years ago, those with darker skin tones would usually avoid mineral sunscreens due to the ashy residue that they leave behind. Thankfully, more brands are becoming inclusive by adding zinc nanoparticles to their mineral sunscreens to improve their textures and remove their ashy finish. You can even find some mineral foundations that incorporate blue-light protection to keep your skin safe from both UV and blue light. Even if you have darker skin, you can find a mineral foundation that will work for you.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re planning on wearing a mineral SPF with nano-zinc ingredients, it’s a good idea to stay out of the sea if you’re heading to the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEverything you need to know about chemical sunscreens\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eChemical sunscreens work by absorbing the UV rays as they hit your skin. The appeal of this formula is that it is easier to apply to your skin and doesn’t leave behind a tell-tale residue. The one thing to consider is that you need to be applying this sunscreen at least fifteen minutes before heading outside, in order for the UV protection to kick in. \u003cbr\u003eMost chemical sunscreens include UV filter ingredients like avobenzone, homosalate, and octisalate. Some of these ingredients are up for debate. While FDA continues to permit their use, the state of Hawaii has banned oxybenzone and octinoxate being used in skincare products.\u003cbr\u003eWhat we love about this type of sunscreen is its texture, which is similar to your daily moisturizer. Just like finding your perfect moisturizer, if you’re a fan of chemical SPFs, you’ll usually not want to switch to a mineral alternative.\u003cbr\u003eWhile a chemical sunscreen will sit better under your makeup, you’ll need to reapply it more than a physical sunscreen. If you’re someone who wants a low-maintenance sunscreen, you’ll likely be better off with a physical sunscreen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHybrid formulas\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDo you want the best of both worlds? It’s worth checking out a hybrid sunscreen formula that combines the best of both chemical and mineral ingredients. These hybrid SPFs give you the flexibility of wearing it under your makeup with the wider protection of a physical sunscreen. \u003cbr\u003eBy blending the two sets of ingredients, you solve the instability that can come from some chemical filters once they are exposed to the light. You can also enjoy a higher SPF with a hybrid formula than what you can achieve with a dedicated physical or chemical formula.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy is there a chemical vs mineral debate?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou might be wondering why there is a debate between chemical and mineral sunscreens. While this debate is ongoing, most dermatologists agree that it is more important to emphasise the need to wear sunscreen over avoiding chemical filters. There is far more scientific evidence backing up the risks and danger of sun exposure than the risk of using chemical sunscreens. \u003cbr\u003eThe FDA has not managed to update their advice on sunscreen for over 10 years. While no new advice has been approved, it’s worth noting that research in 2019 and 2020 found that chemical filters can be absorbed into the skin at a higher concentration that the FDA recommend. The FDA have said that they know these specific chemicals are being absorbed into our bloodstream, but that we aren’t aware of what the significance of this is. \u003cbr\u003eWhatever type of sunscreen you choose to use, the most important thing is that you’re wearing one consistently. While there are concerns about specific chemical filters, a hybrid sunscreen gives you the best of both formulas. If there’s one piece of advice that we can give you, it’s to wear a sunscreen that you know you can wear everyday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eIf you’re someone with a love for designer goods, you know they can come with a steep price tag. Buying on the preloved market can often save you a pretty penny. You can also find bags that are discontinued and highly sought after. Maybe you missed a bag from Louis Vuitton because you couldn’t afford it at the time, or perhaps you’ve always had your eye on a bag you saw in an episode of Sex and the City. The virtual vintage market is booming, especially after the pandemic. Anyone who is trying to shop more sustainability can tell you that the second-hand market is a gold mind. \u003cbr\u003eYet, it can also be a mind field.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re shopping in store, you can take a look at the product and make sure there isn’t any flaws. With super fakes (counterfeit items that look virtually identical to their genuine counterparts) becoming more common, it’s harder to tell a real from a fake. That’s not the only thing to consider. Amongst the gems, there is a lot of products that shouldn’t see the light of day. You might spend a full day of scrolling through Depop before you find anything worth purchasing. \u003cbr\u003eFor every hidden designer bargain, there’s at least ten products that look like they’ve seen better days. Often you might go looking for one item and get distracted by something else entirely different. \u003cbr\u003ePlatforms like Depop are becoming full of independent sellers who go on the hunt for vintage pieces with the purpose of selling them on the pre-loved market. There are sellers that specialise in everything from 90s fashion to vintage Dior bags. With the pandemic making in-person shopping almost impossible, vintage stores and charity shops have turned to apps like eBay and Depop to sell their stock. Other sites like Vestiaire Collective are dedicated to luxury fashion items, with users selling directly to each other.\u003cbr\u003eInstead of walking around the city looking for vintage stores, you can do all your shopping from the comfort of your home. If you want to save your money and help the environment, making virtual vintage purchases might be your new hobby.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re new to the world of virtual vintage shopping, we’ve pulled together all our top tips and ‘need to know’ information to get you started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGet Started\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing you’ll realise is that shopping for vintage items is just like shopping brand new online. You’ll be going through pages and pages of products, the same way you would do on the Zara or H\u0026amp;M website. Just like you have to go-to brands, you’ll soon find go-to sellers who specialise in selling vintage pieces that match your aesthetic. Don’t let the term ‘vintage’ put you off. After all, everything that is vintage becomes new again eventually. \u003cbr\u003eOne reality of buying vintage is that sizing charts have changed massively in recent years. The same way you might fluctuate in sizing between different brands, you may not be the same size in a vintage brand as you are in a contemporary brand. It’s a good idea to make a note of your measurements before you start shopping. While you can filter searches by your dress size, most sellers will also list the exact measurements of the garment. If they do, you can always drop them a message to ask for this information. Not every seller will offer a returns policy, so you want to make sure the clothes will fit you before you commit to buying it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDecide What to Buy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eVintage shopping can be overwhelming. Instead of letting yourself get drawn off course, you want to make a shortlist of a few item you want to find. Just like you go shopping in-store with products in mind, you want to have an idea of what you’re looking for. You may decide to focus on finding vintage Nike pieces or collecting dresses that match a certain aesthetic. \u003cbr\u003eOften, you’ll come across other pieces on your search that grab your attention, but it’s a good idea to go into it with one or two specific items in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eResearch Before Shopping\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eVintage is a far-reaching aesthetic. Most apps offer everything from 1950s fashion to early 2000s nostalgia. If you have a specific era in mind, like the 90s, it’s a good idea to do some research beforehand. Sometimes people are selling things without realising what they actually are. Brands come and go – what might have been a major designer in the 90s may have been forgotten about by now. You may be able to pick up a major bargain by researching brands ahead of time.\u003cbr\u003eSometimes people also price their vintage items too high, simply because they’re vintage. Do your research on fabrics and materials ahead of time. You don’t want to be paying cashmere prices for polyester.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBe Patient\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou might have one week where you’re buying dozens of items, and then go cold turkey. Vintage shopping will ebb and flow. Remember, building a vintage closet is a marathon and not a sprint. You may have your eye on something that you could sell out before you get a chance to add it to your basket. Be patient and keep looking. \u003cbr\u003eYou’ll also need to be patient when you’re waiting for your new purchases to arrive. Private sellers are not like ASOS or Zara, so you may need to wait a few extra days for them to ship your purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUse Filters\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne benefit that virtual vintage shopping has over its in-person counterpart is that you can use filters. This tool is a major time-saver and will let you narrow down your search by everything from dress size to brand or colour. While sometimes it’s fun to see what’s out there, using filters can make it easier to remove listings for products that won’t interest you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYour Items May Not Be Purchased\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile you’ll occasionally find a vintage product that is new with tags, most of them have been previously worn. Pre-loved = pre-worn. Don’t be surprised if you notice a missing button or a mark on your items. The seller should mention this in the description of the item. You can often fix these flaws yourself with an at-home sewing kit or a little elbow grease. If you’re thinking of switching to vintage shopping, it’s a good idea to learn some basic stitching to make any repairs to your new purchases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIf It Doesn’t Work, Resell It\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe vintage market is a great big circular system. The majority of people who purchase pre-loved also sell items themselves. Not only does this declutter your closet, but it can also give you a little extra cash to spend on your next vintage purchase. You might find a bag or jewellery piece that you want to buy, but it’s a little out of your budget. Selling pieces that you no longer wear can help you make up the difference and get your hands on that coveted item. \u003cbr\u003eIf a vintage purchase doesn’t work out, it’s not the end of the world. The size might not work for you or it may look like a disappointment in person compared to the photographs. You can put the item back up on your own profile. Usually you can try to get back what you paid for the item, or you may even be able to make a little extra depending on the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Break The Bank\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003ePeople often assume that vintage instantly means expensive. If you’re buying vintage designer, it can sometimes be more expensive than in-store pieces, especially if it’s been discontinued. Yet, this isn’t always the case. There are always bargains to be found in the vintage fashion world. If you’re looking for mainstream brands like Nike or Adidas, you can still save a pretty penny by purchasing vintage.\u003cbr\u003eYou don’t need to break the bank to buy vintage. If something is a little out of your budget, you can always try to negotiate. Apps like Depop allow you to direct message the seller, who may be willing to sell the item for a cheaper price to get it off their hands. In fact, most people on Depop negotiate a lower price before purchasing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePay with PayPal\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re shopping preloved – especially if it’s for designer items – you want to pay with PayPal. You’ll get an extra layer of protection, which is essential if it turns out your item is a counterfeit or if it doesn’t arrive. You usually get 60 days to open a case with PayPal. It can also make the checkout process easier and avoids you having to enter your credit card details. \u003cbr\u003ePlatforms like PayPal are now offering split payments, which can make it easier to get your hands on more expensive vintage items. If you decide to go down this path, you want to make sure you can make the payments for your items before financing your purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre you a fan of virtual vintage shopping?

Whether you’re a fan of liquid lipstick or like to keep it natural with a pale pink shade, it’s usually the last part of your daily makeup routine. Your lipstick will only look as good as your application. If you’re wearing a darker or bolder shade, you want to be careful to make sure you don’t end up making your lips look lopsided. If you overline your lips too much, you could end up making them appear too superficial. \u003cbr\u003eYou don’t have to be a professional makeup artist to know how to properly apply your lipstick. We’ve rounded up the top tips and tricks for how to flawlessly apply your lipstick every time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStart by Exfoliating Your Lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBefore you can even think of choosing your lipstick colour, you want to smoothen your lips by using an exfoliator. It’s natural for your lips to become dry and flaky as the seasons change, especially if you suffer from dry skin. The first step to your lip application is to use an exfoliator, like a scrub, to remove any dry skin from your lips. You can follow it up with a lip balm to hydrate your lips and leave them plump and hydrated. \u003cbr\u003eAfter you’ve exfoliated and hydrated your lips, you want to leave them to sit for a few minutes before going to the next step. You can use this time to apply other aspect of your makeup routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIf Needed, Colour Correct Your Lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf your lips have a darker pigmentation, you might struggle to have some lipstick colours show up. Instead of being limited by the colours you can use, there is an easy solution. You can colour correct your lips by applying a lighter foundation or powder to your lips to mute their colour. \u003cbr\u003eYou can’t do this step without exfoliating beforehand, as otherwise the powder will seep into the cracks of your lips. When you have a lighter base to work with, you can apply any lipstick colour to your lips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOutline Your Lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhether you want to make your lips appear larger or achieve a more even application, you’ll need to trace and fill in your lips with a lip liner. You can use one that matches the colour of your lipstick, or one that is a few shades lighter than your lipstick for added definition. \u003cbr\u003eYour liner should be used around the edge of your lips, as well as to fill your lips. You’ll want to keep your lip liner on hand when you’re applying your lipstick, as you can use it again to clean the edges and give you a more precise shape to your look.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a more natural look – like a stain – you can skip the eye liner step and instead apply your lipstick colour with your fingertips. You don’t need to worry about being too precise with this step, as you can always go back in with a concealer and brush to clean up any mistakes and perfect your lips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWork with the Shape of Your Lips – Not Against It\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to consider the shape of your lips when you’re applying your lipstick. Whether you have thin or full lips will determine the best way for you to get a flawless finish. \u003cbr\u003e•\tFor thinner lips, you can overdraw with a lip liner that is the same shade as your lipstick. You can go a little bit higher than your natural lip line to give the illusion of fuller lips. You want to make sure you carry this new shape around your lips, lifting your cupid’s bow to the same height as the rest of your line. You want to avoid the temptation to overdraw the corners of your lips. You can finish off your look with a matching lipstick colour, or one that is a shade lighter than your natural lip colour.\u003cbr\u003e•\tWith fuller lips, you want to use a medium or dark lip liner, choosing a lipstick that is a shade or two darker than your natural lip colour. As you already have full lips, you want to avoid overdrawing them. If you want to make your lips appear smaller, you can use a darker colour, while a lighter lipstick shade will make your lips look larger again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWork from The Centre Outwards\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re applying your lipstick, you want to work from the middle of your lips outwards. You should have the most pigment on the centre of your lips, which are also the fullest part. By concentrating here, you have more control over your application and can avoid messing up your lip shape. \u003cbr\u003eIf you find it difficult to create an even shape for your lips, the best solution is to start by creating an X on the cupid’s bow, using your lip liner. This method will give you a more defined cupid’s bow, making it easier to apply the rest of your lip liner around your outer line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou Can Use a Lip Brush for Extra Precision\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you struggle to get your lipstick to apply flawlessly, you can use a lip brush to give you extra control and a more precise line. Not everyone can master the art of using a liner and lipstick. If you’re a beginner, a lip brush can make all the difference. Your lip brush can also give you a more even application. If you still make a mistake with your lip brush, you can go in with a concealer and a flat brush to cover up any mistakes and to give you a smooth outer line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Forget to Blot\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOnce you’ve got your lips flawlessly applied, you want to make sure they don’t smudge. The best way to do this is by blotting your lips. Take a tissue and gently squeeze your lips over it. This process will remove any excess products that might smudge on your lips. You want to repeat this process until you’ve covered all of your lips – including the corners! If you’re using a bolder colour like red, you can go in with a translucent powder to help set the lipstick and prevent it smudging or moving throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBonus Tips: Liquid Lipsticks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOur tips and tricks have so far all been for a traditional lip liner and lipstick combination. While this is what most people use, liquid lipsticks are becoming increasingly popular due to their smudge-proof formulas. \u003cbr\u003eWhat makes a liquid lipstick application different is that they apply like a lip gloss, taking longer for them to set. Once you’ve got the hand of normal lipstick application, you can upgrade to a liquid lipstick. The process is still relatively the same, but you want to focus on exfoliating and moisturizing your lips. \u003cbr\u003eThe difference is that you want to blot and remove any excess lip balm or moisturiser that hasn’t set into your lips. Liquid lipsticks can cause your lips to become dehydrated, so you want to make sure you use a lip balm beforehand. Using too much of a hydrating product you make it more difficult to apply your liquid lipstick, which might run off your lips or smudge if your lips are too greasy.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re applying a liquid lipstick, you want to focus on creating a crisp line. It can help make your liquid lipstick stand out, especially if you choose a bolder colour. Most liquid lipsticks come with a doe-foot applicator, which makes it easier to guide the colour across your lips. \u003cbr\u003eFor liquid lipsticks, you want to do the opposite of a traditional stick lipstick. Work from the outside of your lips first before filling in the centre. Take off any excess from the doe-foot applicator before applying it to your lips, as you want to use a thin and even coat. It’s better to work with fewer layers, as too much product can cause your lips to become flaky.\u003cbr\u003eIf you apply too much of your liquid lipstick, or go outside the lines of your lips, you can go in with a concealer to fix up the line. For a crisper finish, you can go in with a lip liner first to give you a guideline for where to apply your liquid lipstick.\u003cbr\u003eJust like your traditional lipstick, you want to make sure to bot your liquid lipstick to avoid it smudging. Once your liquid lipstick has set, you should be able to enjoy wearing your colour for the rest of the day. \u003cbr\u003eOne thing worth noting is that a liquid lipstick can be harder to remove at the end of the day. You can use an oil-based makeup remover to help dissolve the pigment and remove the colour without dehydrating your lips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is your favourite method for applying lipstick?

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eSlow fashion is a term we’re hearing a lot of right now. In fact, it’s being thrown around in almost every conversation within the fashion industry. But what actually is slow fashion? Why do we need it, and what’s it’s purpose? This guide tells you everything you need to know (and more!) about slow fashion and the philosophy behind it. To understand what slow fashion is, we first have to look at fast fashion, what it means, and the dangers it poses to society and our planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Fast Fashion?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast fashion is all about the speed of which we consume clothing. It’s focused on the fact that we’re buying more clothes than ever before and wearing them for even less than. To keep up with this growing demand, brands are using inexpensive textiles and developing supply chains that are harmful to the planet. The fashion industry is one of the leading causes of pollution in the environment, doing more harm than both international flights and maritime shipping combined.\u003cbr\u003eDue to the increase in demand and high turnover, clothing production has doubled since 2000 with most of these garments falling into the ‘fast fashion’ category. Clothing that you purchase from stores like ASOS, Boohoo, and SheIn all fall into the ‘fast fashion’ category.\u003cbr\u003e‘Fast fashion’ is a 21st-century invention that has grown astronomically thanks to the rise of social media. Trends are evolving every day. Instead of coming out with one collection a season, brands like Zara are releasing up to 20+ collections a year. \u003cbr\u003eIf we were to look at the extent of the damage caused by fast fashion, we’d need an entire series of articles. Here’s some headline stats that can help paint the picture of the harm caused by our love for cheap and inexpensive clothing:\u003cbr\u003e•\tThe fashion industry uses 1.5 trillion litres of water every year, while 750 million people in the world do not have access to safe drinking water. \u003cbr\u003e•\tRoughly 2,000 different chemicals are used to treat textiles during the garment making process. \u0026nbsp;Only 16 of these chemicals are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. \u003cbr\u003e•\tThe environmental impact of dyes and chemicals is most prominent in China, where 80% of groundwater from the major river basins are considered to be “unsuitable” for human contact. \u003cbr\u003e•\tOut of all the human-made debris that is found on the shorelines of oceans and lakes throughout the world, 85% of the debris is the micro-plastics from clothing. \u003cbr\u003e•\t35% of the microplastics in the oceans comes from synthetic textiles such as polyester, which are popular amongst fast fashion brands. \u003cbr\u003eThe danger of fast fashion is as much about how we get rid of our clothing as how they’re made. With trends changing virtually every day, we need to make room for the next ‘must-have’ dress or blazer. Fast fashion means short lifespan, quick production, and a ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ mentality.\u003cbr\u003e•\tAn estimated 85% of textiles end up in landfills around the world, with one garbage truck of clothing being brought to the landfill every second.\u003cbr\u003e•\tThree-fifths of all clothing garments end up in a landfill or incinerator within a year of being purchased.\u003cbr\u003e•\tThe environmental group Greenpeace has estimated that 20% of clothing that we purchase isn’t even worn once, with the average wear of each product being as few as four times.\u003cbr\u003eI’m sure we all have clothing in our closet we’ve worn more than four times, but there’ll be significant chunk that fall into the ‘less than four wears’ category. You might even have pieces in your closet that still have their labels on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Slow Fashion Has Become a Trend\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe danger of fast fashion is everywhere you look, with social media putting a spotlight on the need to shift our focus onto slow fashion instead.\u003cbr\u003eSlow fashion is all about slowing down our rate of consumption and taking a more purposeful look at what we have and what we use. \u003cbr\u003eThe driving force behind the movement is Gen Z and Millenials. 60% of millennials have said that they are trying to shop more sustainably. Between January 2017 and December 2018, there was a 250% increase in the number of google searches for sustainable fashion, showing that there is increasing demand amongst these demographics for more ethical and environmentally friendly fashion options. It’s this demographic that are promoting thrift shopping, ethical fashion brands, and reusable clothing material. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve all been guilty of taking a trip into Zara or H\u0026amp;M and leaving with an arm full of clothes. We’ve all seen the “I only went in for a pair of socks” memes. Instead of buying clothes and accessories on impulse, slow fashion advocates the approach of stopping to consider whether you really need another dress or pair of black shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Can I Embrace Slow Fashion?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith the evolution of ‘slow fashion’, your clothes can still look current and up to date without you having to jump on every momentary trend. Slow fashion is a smart investment, both for your bank balance and the planet.\u003cbr\u003eSlow fashion is about looking at the bigger picture, looking beyond just one or two seasons ahead of yourself. It’s defined by elevated basics that are still contemporary, but that you can wear for years without becoming dated. You can make slow fashion your own, by embracing the philosophy and making it your own. It takes the approach that clothing is an investment, rather than a folly that you can wear one day and throw away the next. Most of us are lucky if we wear something more than once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might be wanting to make the transition to slow fashion, but you don’t know how. Ditch fast fashion trends and look for clothing that you will want to wear for years to come. Quality garments will last for years without becoming easily damaged. Opting for slow fashion doesn’t mean your clothes can’t be on trend. You can still wear contemporary (and new!) clothes. You can think of slow fashion clothing as being ‘of the era’ instead of being on-trends. Instead of thinking of seasonal trends, you want to think of what your own take is on overarching trends – like athleisure, flat footwear, and oversized staples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTips on How to Adopt A Slow Fashion Philosophy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you decide to switch over to slow fashion, it doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy a day out shopping. If anything, slow fashion shopping is even more exciting. Instead of passively consuming clothing, you can take an interest in every piece. \u003cbr\u003eWith its focus on limiting your consumption of clothes, slow fashion promotes researching as much as you can about your clothes. Take an interest in finding out more about the brands that you’re interested in buying from. Brands that use sustainable materials or have ethical supply chains always make a point of including this information on their website, so it’ll be easy to find independent brands that you can support on their slow fashion mission. You can also research different materials and textiles to know what to look for and which ones to avoid. Almost every ‘fast fashion’ material has a more sustainable alternative – like organic cotton compared to traditional cotton.\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most popular ways of adopting slow fashion is to create a capsule wardrobe. This idea is focused on clearing out your closet and building it around elevated staples that you can mix and match together to create dozens of looks. When you have a capsule closet, you’ll usually adopt a ‘one in, one out’ approach to your closet. If you want to buy something new, you’ll have to donate or sell another piece in your closet.\u003cbr\u003eThe concept of slow fashion is as much about how you treat your clothing as what it’s made of. You want to make a vow to wear each piece of clothing in your closet at least ten times. If there’s something you know that you rarely wear, it might help to keep a log of when you’ve worn it. That way you’ll know when it’s time to take it out for another day on the town. \u003cbr\u003eAlong with making more meaningful purchases and changing your approach to how you get rid of clothes, there’s one more thing we can all do to promote slow fashion. If brands know their consumers are looking for sustainable alternatives – and that there’s money to be there – they’re more likely to take up environmental initiatives and change with the times. Thanks to social media, it’s never been easier to get in touch with your favourite brands. Why not drop them an Instagram DM or an email asking them what their environmental policies are and if they’re committed to slow fashion? The more brands see a growing demand for sustainable fashion, the more likely they are to change their approach.\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes time to get rid of your clothing, you want to avoid sending it to landfill at all costs. While sometimes this can’t be avoided, you can donate your clothing or sell it through apps like Depop or eBay to make a little extra cash.\u003cbr\u003eThe whole point of slow fashion is about taking the principles – sustainability and investing – and applying it to your aesthetic and style. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you think of slow fashion?

While eCommerce offers great convenience, it still doesn’t match the consumer-product connection. \u003cbr\u003eBut, same as everything else, the online shopping industry is continuously evolving. Livestream shopping somewhat manages to provide that connection that an eCommerce store doesn’t. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eIn this article, you’ll know why we think that livestream shopping is the next big thing in retail. And, why you should be taking it seriously for your retail business. \u003cbr\u003eLet’s dive in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Evolution of Retail \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe retail industry has seen a drastic shift in the last decade. What consumers used to buy in retail shops is now delivered to their doorsteps. \u003cbr\u003eThanks to our busy lifestyles and the one-click purchase convenience, most people prefer buying from eCommerce stores. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, there is still something missing in the eCommerce store model. A buyer can’t feel or touch a product unless it gets delivered to their home. \u003cbr\u003eThis is why there is a high return rate in eCommerce shopping. And, consumers prefer buying certain products after physically checking them. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, while you can show your product in a recorded video, it still doesn’t offer the one-to-one connection a livestream offers. \u003cbr\u003eSo, inevitably, livestream is proving to be quite effective at educating the prospects about brands and their products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat’s Livestream Shopping?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eTraditional retail stores are great for one-to-one interaction with the brand and products. Whereas, eCommerce allows you to expand your reach virtually to anywhere in the world. \u003cbr\u003eAs a brand, you are not limited by location in eCommerce. Livestream shopping offers a blend of both. \u003cbr\u003eLivestream shopping is when consumers interact with a brand or its products digitally and make live buying decisions. \u003cbr\u003eIt could be from anywhere your customers can access your live video.\u003cbr\u003eLivestreams allow shoppers to see the products in action and satisfy themselves before going through with the purchase. \u003cbr\u003eA livestream enables you to educate your prospects about your products more effectively. Done right, livestreams can be a great way to maximize a brand’s sales or conversions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy is Livestream Shopping the Future of Retail?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere should be no doubt that the future of retail is digital. And, livestream shopping is an important part of this digital revolution. \u003cbr\u003eIt’s important to understand what makes livestream shopping so much effective as compared to one-click eCommerce stores.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIt Lets Consumers Make a More Informed Decision \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to helping the prospects make an informed decision, livestream shopping takes the lead. One of the most obvious reasons why statistics show a high return rate in eCommerce is the lack of necessary education/information about the products. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, while a recorded video can also help people know a lot about a product, a livestream lets them clear their minds through questions. \u003cbr\u003eMoreover, a major reason why livestreams are in popularity in the retail industry is that prospects get to see the product live. \u003cbr\u003eYou can explain a feature but showing it will always be more effective. When consumers can see a product in action, they can put their trust in the product more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA Livestream Let You Use FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason why livestreams are so effectively utilized by brands is that they are immediate in nature. This means viewers can only act on your offers as long as you are live. \u003cbr\u003eOf course, you’d have to offer something to drive action from them. For instance, a live contest where the winner gets a special discount on your flagship product. \u003cbr\u003eAnother example would be to offer a product bundle at a lower price point during the livestream. Livestreams leverage our innate psychology of not wanting to miss out on something good cleverly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA Livestream Can Reduce Product Returns \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eProduct returns can be quite damaging to a business. They don’t only hurt your profits but can also be harmful to your reputation. \u003cbr\u003eLivestreams can help you virtually eliminate the possibility of product returns. How? \u003cbr\u003eSimply put, the more your prospects know about your product, the more confident purchase decision they would make. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, the more confident they feel about your product, the lower the chances that they’ll return it. So, livestreams can not only convert your audience but can also help drive well-informed and confident purchases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIt Allows Brands to Connect with Their Prospects\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe one-to-one nature of livestreams enables brands to connect with their potential customers on a more personal level. \u003cbr\u003eConsumers see livestreams as an honest representation of a product or brand. With a livestream, you show the real picture without having to market your product at all. \u003cbr\u003eYour prospects can build a relationship of trust with your brand. They feel more connected to your brand and product, which leads to brand loyalty and long-term customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLivestreams are Cost-Effective\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eCompared to a recorded video, implementing a livestream effectively is an inexpensive process and brings better results as well. \u003cbr\u003eFor a livestream, you don’t need to edit your videos, which saves you time and money. Plus, you don’t need to have very sophisticated equipment to carry out an impactful livestream. \u003cbr\u003eJust a decent camera, professional software, and a fast-enough device can do the job. However, if you have the budget for it, using a higher-quality camera is always a plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFuture of Retail\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe fact that China has been leveraging livestreams quite effectively has encouraged the west to jump on the bandwagon of livestream. \u003cbr\u003eIn 2019, only China’s market share of livestream commerce was $1.4 Billion. \u003cbr\u003eA lot of brands are now using livestreams to get their business in front of more people and to increase their brand awareness. \u003cbr\u003eThe successful implementation of livestream by Chinese eCommerce companies shows that livestream shopping isn’t something that’s going to fade away in the future. \u003cbr\u003eAccording to statistics, China is projected to sell around $400 Billion worth of products by the end of 2022. \u003cbr\u003eThe success of livestream shopping will mainly depend on whether people will continue to shop online. And, that trend seems to be going upwards in the future. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, while Asia has been reportedly leading the live commerce market, giants from the west are also following suit. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA prominent reason why we are seeing an upward trend in eCommerce is that consumers don’t want to visit brick-and-mortar shops anymore. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, when it comes to live commerce, it goes a step further and offers something only brick-and-mortar shops could offer. \u003cbr\u003eLive commerce allows consumers to see the product live, but digitally. It’s effective because it emulates the brick-and-mortar experience to some extent. \u003cbr\u003eSince the pandemic, people have not been able to go out with confidence and shop for their favorite products. This is one reason why livestream shopping is taking the central position in the online shopping industry. \u003cbr\u003eIf you are thinking of leveraging this tried and tested selling strategy for your business, you have a lot of options. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, not all platforms will provide you good control over your business livestreams. You see, giants like Facebook won’t give their data to the users. \u003cbr\u003eSo, you’ll be depending on them for virtually all your user data. On the flip side, if you opt for a dedicated livestream platform, you’d be controlling your audience data and use it for further growth. \u003cbr\u003eIf you think you’d be better off having full control, Jumble’s livestream software is for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eGone are the days when physical retail shops were the only options for consumers to shop. The unprecedented growth of eCommerce in the last decade has made shopping a breeze. \u003cbr\u003eConsumers don’t have to do anything more than a click of a button and the product reaches their home within hours. \u003cbr\u003eLivestream shopping is a relatively new concept and is proving to be quite impactful for brands. The fact that consumers can see the products in action lets them make confident buying decisions. \u003cbr\u003eThe more you inform your prospects about your product, the higher your chances of driving conversions. And, livestreams make that pretty easy for a brand. \u003cbr\u003eThe retail market first transformed from brick-and-mortar to eCommerce and now integrating live commerce as well. \u003cbr\u003eIf you aren’t using livestream for your brand, now would be the time.

After all, your home is your palace. Whether you’re renting a studio apartment or building your forever home, you want to take pride in your living space and inject a little of your personality into it. Just like fashion, interior design trends are always evolving to meet the needs of our modern lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003eUpdating your interior design is the perfect way to refresh your home without breaking the bank. You can make little changes here and there or undertake a DIY project to completely transform a room. If you’re planning to work remotely from home, it’s time to give your living space a little TLC and a new look. If you’re going to spend all your time at home, it may as well look pretty! \u003cbr\u003eWe’re sharing five of the most exciting interior design movements that we’re loving for 2021. You can mix and match these different aesthetics to help create your new interior décor or use one as inspiration for your space. Remember – not everyone room in your house has to have the same look and feel to it. Every room in your apartment or house serves a unique function, which should be reflected in the interior design and furniture choices that you make. \u003cbr\u003eHere are our five favourite interior design movements for 2021:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCreate a Timeless Space\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInterior design can be expensive and if you want a look that can stand the test of time, you want to stick to the classics. Instead of creating a space that looks unapologetically modern, you want to make a room that looks like it’s always been that way. Stick to the tried-and-tested favourites, whether it’s leather seats or minimalistic artwork. \u003cbr\u003eAs part of your space, you want to think about the atmosphere that you’re creating. Often, it’s how the room makes you feel that makes it timeless. Rooms that are both simple and functional can be warm and inviting. Add multi-functional pieces that you can utilize in everyday life. Are you turning your spare room into a office to work remotely? You can add a diffuser as a piece of décor that doubles as a de-stressing tool. Adding multi-tasking items and décor to your room can help reduce clutter and give your space a more streamlined feel.\u003cbr\u003eA timeless space is whatever looks and feels timeless for you. Timelessness doesn’t mean you have to turn your back on modernism. The two can often go hand in hand. Instead of being influenced by one specific trend or something you’ve seen on Instagram, focus on buying items that create a space you can see yourself enjoying for years to come. Not only is it more sustainable and classic, it’ll save you money in the long run!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePlay Around with Textiles and Materials\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’ve all been guilty of finding a textile or print that we like and using it on everything. One interior design movement that we are loving is the focused on elevated materiality, moulding together different textiles and textures to create a sense of depth to your space. Mixing and matching your textiles can make your space feel more inviting and add a layer of richness to the room. \u003cbr\u003eThis approach can give you the opportunity to play into more than one side of your interior design aesthetic. You can show off every side of your personality with a different choice of material or textile. This trend is a great way of adding in different influences to your space, whether it’s a vintage upholstered armchair or a marble feature. \u003cbr\u003eYou can recreate the feel of a specific interior design aesthetic while keeping it anchored in another look or aesthetic by adding in different textures and colours to your space. This concept is the perfect one to experiment with if you and your partner have very different interior design preferences. You can find a way to mash them together and make them work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIgnore the Trends\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile this one might seem a little counterproductive, we promise there’s a philosophy behind it! We’re seeing a growing focus on the concept of individualizing interior design. You want to make your space uniquely your own. Instead of being dragged in by the trends and thinking your homes has to look a certain way, you can instead focus on making it look how you want to make it look. After all, you’re the one who is going to be spending their time in the room.\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending a year indoors and working from home, we’ve probably all picked up things we’d like to change and replace about our home. While it’s a great idea to flick through magazines and Pinterest to get inspiration for your interior design, you shouldn’t feel like you have to copy a space like-for-like. Instead, identify the pieces you like and add them gradually to your space.\u003cbr\u003eJust like fashion trends, interior design is becoming even more focused on sustainability. You can shop second-hand for pre-loved furniture that matches your interior design aesthetic or you can reuse and repurpose old furniture that you’ve had handed down to you from a family memory. \u003cbr\u003eTo make your space as individualistic as possible, you want to add as many different bespoke features as you can. Instead of shopping in department stores and furniture shops, go into small and independent stores to see what unique pieces they have. You never know when you might come across a gem, Auctions and estate sales are another great opportunity to get your hands on a piece that no one else has.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you have an item that is uniquely your own, you’ll love it even more. You want your friends and family to be able to walk into your space and instantly recognise that it’s your home. \u003cbr\u003eOther things we’re noticing within the individualism movement is a move away from cooler colours to more warm neutrals that give a space a warm and inviting feel. Green is a colour that is starting to pop up everywhere as a way of adding a fashionable touch to your space. If you want to add green without painting your walls that colour, you can incorporate house plants or art in the same colour family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMake What Was Once Old New Again\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re looking around for your style inspiration, you might come across a photo of a kitchen or living room from decades ago and wished that you could recreate it. While you might not be able to bring in the wood panelling and tiny stove, you can take the bygone trends and make them new again.\u003cbr\u003eFor example, we’re seeing interior designers choosing to step away from the all-white kitchen that have been dominating the industry for decades. Instead, designers are choosing to incorporate nature-inspired colours with metal accents to add extra warmth and richness to the space. \u003cbr\u003eIf you fall in love with a style or aesthetic of interior design from a specific time period, you can be almost certain to find a contemporary equivalent. Interior design is always evolving, meaning you can usually find a similar piece, albeit with a modern twist. Bring along some inspiration photos for your shopping trip and see if you can find any pieces that have the same characteristics as the older trends that caught your eye.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re set on an older aesthetic or the idea of making some old new again, you might want to consider repurposing older furniture. Perhaps you have your heart set on a high-back reclining chair, but you want to give it a modern twist. You can purchase a vintage one that matches the silhouette you want, and then reupholster it to give the chair a contemporary look. Even when you’re investing in alterations and upholstering, it’ll usually work out significantly cheaper to buy your interior design pieces second-hand than brand new from the store.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAdding Personality To Your Home\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne interior design movement that we can get behind 100% is the one that focuses on adding your personality into the space. The pandemic has made us all think about our homes and what we want out of them. Your home should be a welcoming environment that makes you feel relaxed and rejuvenated. You want a space that looks and feels like it’s your home – and not a showroom. \u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to paint the walls your favourite colour or to add a piece of furniture that you catch sight of across a room and found yourself running towards. Your room should be just as interesting (if not more so!) than you are. General trends show a move towards bolder colour palettes that bring an instant dose of confidence and live to any space. \u003cbr\u003eTo inject your personality into a space, you can experiment with textiles, shapes, and décor. By pieces that speak to your soul and that allow you to reflect your personality into your home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these five interior design movements is your favourite?

It helps with your moisture retention and keeps your skin both plump and hydrated. What makes hyaluronic acid unique is that it can hold up to thousand times its weight in water. Along with hydrating your skin, it keeps your moisture locked into your skin, instead of allowing it to evaporate in the air. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs we get older, our hyaluronic acid decreases, just like our \u003ca href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/collagen-health-benefits-food-sources-supplements-types-more/\"\u003ecollagen \u003c/a\u003eand elastin.

The best way of getting more hyaluronic acid into your skin is through products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eHyaluronic acid is a multi-tasking component that hydrates your skin, giving it a plump and glowing appearance. When your skin is hydrated, it boosts your natural protective barrier to reduce oxidative stress and protect against free radical damage. When your skin is rich in hyaluronic acid, you have a brighter complexion and a smoother surface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHyaluronic Acid in Skincare\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA common misconception about hyaluronic acid is that you should avoid it if you have\u003ca href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-care-routine-for-oily-skin-2\"\u003e oily skin.\u003c/a\u003e In fact, every skin type needs hyaluronic acid, as it naturally occurs within your skin cells. If your skin is dehydrated, it can cause your skin to overproduce oil and sebum to compensate. When you’re trying to get your oily skin under control, hyaluronic acid can help balance your moisture levels and regulate your oil production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why hyaluronic acid is added to skincare products is to moisturise the dermis of your skin. As the ingredient holds up to thousand times its weight in water, you want it to sit on the top of the skin to attract and retain moisture. Most of the skincare products you already use likely contain some level of hyaluronic acid. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s included in almost every product as a way of boosting your elastin and to give your skin a dewy glow.

Not all hyaluronic acid is made equally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere are two main types of hyaluronic acid:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e•\tHA with a high molecular weight has a larger molecule, which allows it to boost your skin’s protective barrier along the surface.

To get the most out of the hyaluronic acid, you can incorporate it in a micronized form or within other ingredients that make it easier to penetrate into your skin. If you buy the wrong form of hyaluronic acid, it’ll simply sit on the top of your skin, without doing anything on a cellular level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you use hyaluronic acid the wrong way, it can dehydrate your skin. It needs to be used in a water substance to help plump the skin and reach the deeper layers below your dermis. It’s a good idea to apply your hyaluronic acid serums and creams on damp skin. Your serum will perform better if you seal it in with a moisturizer to lock-in the water retention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eInjectable Hyaluronic Acid\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to get hyaluronic acid into your skin quickly and effectively, injections might be the best way to go. These injections use a gel form of hyaluronic acid that are injected into the dermis layer of the skin. You can target it to areas of your skin to smooth fine lines and wrinkles, as well as decreasing shadows on your skin. One thing to note is that injectable hyaluronic acid will slowly dissolve in your skin over the course of a year, so you’ll need to top it up overtime. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eHyaluronic acid adds volume to your face as it daws in the moisture in the area, acting like a natural filler for your skin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne benefit of injectable hyaluronic acid is that it has little to no side effects. While you may experience a little bruising or swelling, this usually will soothe within a few days. If you decide that you want to use injectable hyaluronic acid, you want to go to a trained dermatologist. Your skin absorbs everything that you put into it. You need to do your due diligence and make sure you’re using a licensed clinic. If the injections are used incorrectly, they can hit a blood vessel and lead to health issues. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re debating injections of any kind, hyaluronic acid is the healthiest one to inject into your skin. As your skin already produces hyaluronic acid, it’s not a foreign body for your skin. You can use it anywhere on your body or face, including your nose to give the illusion of a nose job by filling in specific areas of the nose to improve its shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eHyaluronic acid injectables are ideal for investing in before a special occasion or when your skin needs a pick-me-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you use hyaluronic acid as part of your skincare routine?

While a cotton blend will still work, the colour effect won’t be as vibrant and may wash off after your first wear. Dyes bond better with natural fabrics, including silk and rayon, but cotton is the most common choice. If you’re not sure what to start with when you’re doing your first at-home tie-dye DIY, we recommend using a plain white cotton shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e•\tYou can buy your dye kits off Amazon or from a local crafts store.

Check the back of the soda ash label to make sure you’re using the right amount. The temperature of your dye bath should be the same as a baby’s bath. Make sure to wear your rubber gloves while you’re soaking the shirt into the water solution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"\"\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e•\tOnce the water is soaked, squeeze it to rinse out as much of the liquid as possible.

You can’t be sure if most of them are even available to interact with you live. \u003cbr\u003eWhat you can do is, schedule your livestream so that people that want to connect with you dedicate that time to it. \u003cbr\u003eCreate a poster and include the exact date and time of the livestream.

This can push your content to the relevant audience on different platforms. \u003cbr\u003eLet’s say you are promoting your livestream on Facebook.

Moreover, if you have an email list, send them an email telling them when you are going live. \u003cbr\u003eYou can also ask your friends and family to spread the word around and maximize your reach. \u003cbr\u003eThe more your plans get in front of relevant people, the more your chances to engage with the right people. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, the more will be the chances of generating sales.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAsk Prospects to Register\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can kill two birds with one stone using this strategy. By registering people for your livestream, you’ll also be collecting their contact information, which you can use later in your marketing efforts. \u003cbr\u003eYou can also make sure they don’t miss the live event by sending them a final reminder just before going live. \u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line is, the more viewers you can attract, the higher sales you can generate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWork with an Influencer\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInfluencer marketing is a relatively new strategy that’s bringing great results in virtually every industry. Look at this stat: Marketers get a $5.78 ROI (return on investment) for every $1 spent on influencer marketing. \u003cbr\u003eTo leverage influencer marketing, all you’d need to do is find the right influencer and host a livestream with them. \u003cbr\u003eIn addition to engaging your existing audience with your brand, this strategy will attract new prospects, allowing you to increase your sales. \u003cbr\u003eTry to get the influencer to use your product and review it on the livestream. It shouldn’t have to be too salesy. Just an honest review will do. \u003cbr\u003ePeople trust the influencers they follow. So, when a credible influencer recommends a product, the followers are likely to follow suit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEngage with the Audience\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eKeeping your livestream engaging should be your top priority. Your livestream should be interesting and encourage viewers to interact with you. \u003cbr\u003eAsk your audience to ask anything they want to know about your products or brand. Answer them right there if you can. \u003cbr\u003eAlternatively, you can note the most relevant questions and answer them in your next stream. \u003cbr\u003eImportantly, don’t go overboard with the timing of the livestream. Even if someone has got time for you, they would prefer to go somewhere else if your livestream doesn’t address their interests. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eIt all comes down to sales: A higher engagement will almost always lead to higher sales volume.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShow the Product Live\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLivestream provides an excellent platform for showcasing what your product can do. While eCommerce offers great convenience, it still lacks the intimate product-consumer connection. Something a customer can only experience at a brick-and-mortar shop. \u003cbr\u003eWhat you can do is, show every benefit and feature of your product on a livestream and do an open question and answer session at the end. \u003cbr\u003eThe more your audience is going to know about your product, the more people you’ll be able to convert.\u003cbr\u003eAsk your livestream host to show the product in action to make the viewers understand how they are supposed to use it. \u003cbr\u003eAnother way to educate your viewers about your product would be to create a short explainer video about the product. \u003cbr\u003eYou can play it within the livestream. Then, answer any potential questions that the audience might have about the explainer video. \u003cbr\u003eShowing every detail of your product will not only help you get more sales, but it’ll also reduce your product return rate. \u003cbr\u003eHow? Because when there is nothing that the consumer doesn’t know about the product, there will be no reason to return it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eConduct Live Question and Answer Sessions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs a brand, you want to address every question your potential buyers have. Any unanswered query leaves doubt in their minds. This can hurt your conversions or sales. \u003cbr\u003eThere will be a large chunk of consumers that need to know everything about a product before they can invest in it. \u003cbr\u003eThese high-quality sales will help you create top-notch content that’ll satisfy virtually every consumer out there. \u003cbr\u003eThe best way is to conduct a special question and answer live session about your product. Give the control to your audience. Let them ask whatever they want. Try answering every query about your product in the simplest way possible. \u003cbr\u003eMoreover, Q\u0026amp;A sessions will help you establish yourself as a trusted brand in your industry. When you can address their pain points effectively, you gain their trust. \u003cbr\u003eMake sure when you end your session, you leave your audience completely satisfied, ready to make their purchase decision confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLeverage FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFear of missing out is one of the most effective selling tactics. It simply works because consumers don’t want to miss out on an opportunity. \u003cbr\u003eMany consumers don’t act because they leave it for later. This attitude can easily lead to inaction. Using FOMO, you can push these prospects over the edge and make them buy your product. \u003cbr\u003eWhat you can do is, offer something that your potential buyers don’t want to miss out on. For instance, slash 10% off if they buy your product during the livestream. \u003cbr\u003eAs the offer will only be valid until the stream ends, you’d be leveraging the fear of missing out. Tell them what price they would have to pay after the offer ends. \u003cbr\u003eAnother impactful strategy to get people to pull their wallets out is offering product bundles at a relatively lower price. \u003cbr\u003eBut again, your offer should only stand for a limited period. Make sure you don’t keep it after the deadline. Otherwise, your prospects might not believe you the next time. And, customers’ trust is an important asset in business. \u0026nbsp; \u003cbr\u003eYou can also use other techniques to evoke the FOMO. These include:\u003cbr\u003e•\tMentioning a celebrity or an influencer\u003cbr\u003e•\tShowing social proof or customer testimonials\u003cbr\u003e•\tOffering a discount for a limited number of sales\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA livestream isn’t only great for connecting with your prospects, but it can also help you increase your sales. \u003cbr\u003eUsing an engaging livestream, you can educate your audience about your product, helping them make an informed buying decision. \u003cbr\u003eYou can also use the FOMO during your livestreams by offering a limited-time offer to make more sales. In addition, show social proof and answer any questions the audience might have to build your trust and credibility. \u003cbr\u003eIt all comes down to this: An engaging livestream can help you get more sales.

One of the most significant features was \u003ca href=\"https://poiret.com/fr/brand/la-grande-couture\"\u003ePaul Poiret\u003c/a\u003e, who incorporated ethnic detailing and Middle Eastern elements. It was during this time that William Morris, the popular interior designer and fashion designer, began to incorporate bohemian motifs into his work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBohemian fashion took on another life in the 1960s, when it came into partnership with the hippie movement. Both the fashion and philosophy rebuked the conventional lifestyle. The popularity of the hippie movement brought bohemian fashion into the mainstream. New clothing styles came to define the fashion aesthetic, including delicate embroidery, voluminous sleeves, fringe detailing, and flared trousers. The hippie movement adopted the bohemian fashion because they saw it as a physical representation of their rejection of established social constructions. The free-flowing silhouettes of the bohemian aesthetic came in contrast with the more polished and streamlined look of the rest of society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Must-Have Pieces for a Boho Chic Closet\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhenever you’re experimenting with a new aesthetic, the easiest way to incorporate it into your lifestyle is to build a capsule closet. That way you can have pieces to mix and match with your existing closet. You only need a handful of pieces to get you started on your boho chic journey. Due to its love of prints and bright colours, you can mix and match virtually any two pieces together. The ‘rules’ around styling for boho chic is more relaxed than any other aesthetic. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBoho chic is synonymous with is neutral-tone palette, but over recent years, pastel colours have found their way into the aesthetic. The purpose of bohemian fashion is to reflect your personality and values. As a free-flowing aesthetic, you can put your own twist on bohemian fashion to make it your own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBohemian + Boho Chic Tops\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re shopping for boho chic tops, you want to search for loose and relaxed fitted silhouettes. Some of the most popular shirt styles incorporate bell sleeves with a half or three-quality length sleeve. It’s not unusual to see decorative elements, like pompoms and tassels, attached to the collars of these blouses. Depending on your preferred look, you can add a boho chic top with a v-neckline or an off-the-shoulder cut. These loose-fitting tops can be styled with everything from classic denim shorts to flared trousers. If you’re starting out with bohemian fashion, these tops are a perfect way to experiment with the look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBohemian + Boho Chic Trousers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere is a more versatile selection of trousers for you to choose from. You can add anything from flared jeans to a maxi skirt or denim shorts to your capsule boho chic closet. A general rule of thumb is that you want to find trousers with a flared silhouette, while dresses should have a flowy feel, with mixed prints and added embroidery. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBohemian + Boho Chic Dresses\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps what boho chic is most known for is its beautiful dresses, which anyone can enjoy throughout the spring and summer months. The most popular styles are those with an a-line cut and relaxed fit. You’ll rarely see full-length sleeve, as most re either half or three-quality length. For maxi dresses, off-the-shoulder prairie designs are popular, incorporating mixed prints and embroideries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBohemian + Boho Chic Outerwear\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFinding bohemian outerwear is one of the easiest pieces to add to your capsule closet. The easiest way to do so is with thrifted or second-hand pieces. It’s worth looking out for distressed denim jackets, kimonos that feature classic bohemian motifs, and sheepskin coats. You want to find outwear that is comfortable and relaxed, with slightly oversized fit. Boho chic clothing is never skin-tight or too form fitting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBohemian + Boho Chic Footwear\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to bohemian footwear, leather is king. You want to think of footwear similar to what you might wear to a music festival or during the summer. It’s worth looking out for suede ankle boots for the colder months and leather sandals for the spring and summer months. Classic boho chic footwear focuses on warm hues, like brown and beige colours. If you decide to wear a platform shoe, you want to avoid stilettoes and instead choose a chunky or block heel. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBohemian + Boho Chic Accessories \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re starting to experiment with boho chic for the first time, you can choose some accessories to add to your existing closet. Bohemian accessories have hardly changed since the 70s, making them perfect pieces to pick up on the second-hand or vintage market. Your accessories should focus on ethnic patters and mixed prints, with braid detailing and patchwork designs. If you’re looking for jewellery, search for pieces with an antique finish. Other features to look out for include fringe and tassel detailing, whether it’s on scarves or handbags.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCurrent Boho Chic Trends\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSome of the biggest trends of 2022 have a bohemian feel to them. \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/how-tie-dye-became-the-lockdown-trend\"\u003eTie-dye \u003c/a\u003eis the perfect example of this.

The less bizarre than the 80’s yet not less interesting combinations and pieces that stand out with their simplicity, elements that marked a decade. It is interesting to observe how cycles in fashion keep coming around and are being recycled, yet the 90’s has left the most prominent mark and its comeback is engraved in the classics list. While the list goes on and on and can be summarized by ‘dad’s fashion’, there is more that we would like to turn your attention to. While some might only come back the second time around for season, there are undoubtedly others that have become a must have. Here are some of our favourite parts of the back in the days trends that are turning heads to themselves once again:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHeels with socks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eScreaming out Carrie Broadshow, this combination so awkward yet so catchy, screams confidence and fun weirdness. Definitely a harder one to match with your outfit, however to be able to pull this one off is a bold fashionista move. Elegant heels with patterned or even simple white socks will add funk to whatever you put on. You might consider how well it goes with oversized blazers and a short skirt, or under long pants. Think of intricate lace socks with high platform heels, or knee high socks with platforms, under a cute dress. Sporty Nike socks with elegant heels, under a funky dress. Quirky and flashy, with such a small detail your whole outfit is transformed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMesh and sheer\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGive quite a big sneak peak of your shapes, mesh tops with a cheeky bralette have come back around a while ago and have become the ultimate basic party go-to. Sheer dresses are the perfect solution for a restaurant day on the beach, covering you up just enough while allowing you to feel free and loose. Flowy long sheer dresses give you the perfect balance between intricacy and boldness, leaving you to be seen between the folds flowing in the wind. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWindbreakers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis absolute classic is one that all of us must have in our wardrobe. Handy and easy to match with anything, we specifically like patterned ones more, over the plain Nike ones. Perfect on a sunny day with cold wind, in autumn over a sweater, on your mountain hike, on your walk down to get groceries. A bike ride or a day with friends, this casual piece of clothing is handy and simple to use for different occasions and with different moods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSpaghetti straps\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only downside of this element is finding the right and comfortable enough bra to wear with it. A tank top with spaghetti straps becomes a strap top you can wear with a cheek outfit, match it with pants, jeans or any skirt and throw on some heels. The most iconic use of this element however is in a dress. Elegance and fragile, emphasizing the delicate neckline and revealing the shoulders, this is bound to make you slay at any event. Think any fashion icon back in the 90’s and most in our 21st century, all own at least one dress with straps like these. We love how feminine it is, accentuating some of the most beautiful parts of our bodies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWide-legged, slouchy and pencil trousers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou see more and more that low effort outfits are not necessarily making anyone less dressed up. We are loving how many big brands are embracing the-wider-the-better move, making the trousers looser, wider and more flowy. High waisted pants matched with some platform heels or boots or even just slides are a summer look you must have this year. Casual yet chic, relaxed yet dressed up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThick headbands\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlaire Waldorf with her iconic move with these headbands has shown how much character a small detail can give to your look. Cute and bold, there are thousands of styles of these thick headbands you can find. Colorful and playful patterns with your summer dress or a more classy one to go with your little black dress. Accessories can make all the change sometimes and these headbands are a unique touch to add to your collection. Try getting a little scarf of the same color as the headband and connecting it to your bag. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eClaw clips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fastest way to get a classy hairstyle with just one move. Throw it in your bag on a not so good hair day and you will have a little something to throw it back in one move. We do enjoy the smaller claw clips for a half up half down look, but those long ones that you can use to collect all of your hair, twisting it around in a sausage and putting it upwards against the back of your scalp. You can create the famous slicked back low ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSlip dresses\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe definition of classy minimalist look is perfect for a night out or a little aesthetically pleasing picnic, we especially love the satin dresses. The way they underline the figure especially when a bit loose, the material and the way it flows down will make anyone feel glowy. An interesting twist to it is to wear it over a t-shirt with some combat boots or platform shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSleeveless vests and jackets\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sleeveless sweater vests are the ultimate 2020-2021 piece. Perfect for spring or a summer night, easy to wear and easier to use to add some class to any simple outfit, this piece is a classic to obtain. Sleeveless pieces can be tougher to match during a cold season, but a tight long sleeve top or sweater is the perfect combination. Sleeveless jackets are lifesavers for between season times and can be worn as easily to the shop as out to a restaurant or terrasse. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBaggy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate quality of 90s fashion is baggy. Baggy everything. It makes everything more comfortable and not any less stylish. Baggy jeans weather flared or mom jeans are to hunt for, often designed well by some brands in a way it does not take away from your form but only enhances them, while keeping it super casual and cool. Oversized has been in for a while and it certainly another feeling to put a baggy t-shirt or hoodie over some tighter bottoms. However, the bigger the better. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSlides\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith some of the most luxurious brands taking their turn to incorporate these classics in their collections, there are really some to die for. Arguably the most comfortable and comforting shoes, these make you feel at home anywhere you go. For a perfect beach lunch or stroll around on a sunny day, you can get these fluffy or a tighter fit. Practically matchable with anything, slides have made their mark in history for a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

This term is more ambiguous, but it’s essentially a skin type where you suffer from problems or inconveniences like dry patches, excess oil production, and breakouts. You could fall into any of the mainstream categories, while also having problematic skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhatever your skin type is, you want to consider the reality of dead skin cells. The main cause for dull-looking skin is dead skin cells and impurities that clog up your pores and create an uneven texture. Your skin sheds thousands of dead skin cells every day. If you have sensitive skin, you’ll want to pay extra attention to the cleansers that you use. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWherever possible, it’s best to look for natural ingredients that will nourish you skin and avoid irritants like parabens and chemicals that might irritate your skin. One thing you want to avoid in general is artificial fragrance, including essential oils.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKnowing Which Skincare Products to Use\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want to develop a consistent \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/skincare\"\u003eskincare routine \u003c/a\u003ethat you can follow both morning and night. Your routines should be fairly similar for both parts of the day, but you can swap out specific products, like your moisturizer, to better target your skin overnight. The night-time is when your skin is working overtime to repair and renew your skin cells, so you can use more potent products then to boost your complexion/\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to use a ten or twelve-part skincare routine \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-must-follow-k-beauty-instagram-accounts-that-everyone-is-talking-about\"\u003e(like a Korean skincare routine)\u003c/a\u003e. Carefully choosing five or six products that work for your skin can be just as effective. Your skincare routine should be four steps. Cleanse, tone, treat and moisturise. Your cleanser and toner remove the dead skin cells and impurities from your skin, while tightening your pores and evening your skin surface. By cleaning your skin, these products make it easier for you to absorb the active ingredients in your products. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ‘treating’ stage of your skincare routine is where you can personalise it to meet your specific skincare concerns with serums and oils. It’s worth researching what ingredients work best for your skin type. You can incorporate products like caffeine, which can help reduce the appearance of dark under eye circles. \u003ca href=\"https://inside-our-products.loreal.com/ingredients/vitamin-e\"\u003eVitamin E\u003c/a\u003e is another ingredient worth looking out, as it works for all skin types. This ingredient will reduce sun damage and help diminish the appearance of scars and imperfections on your skin, while giving you a boost of hydration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA moisturizer is the final step of your skincare routine. It serves to hydrate your skin and lock-in the active ingredients in your other products. You can swap your moisturizer out at night-time for a thicker formula to help repair your skin on cellular level overnight. Moisturizer is the one product you can’t afford to skip. It’s the secret to a dewy glow as it leaves your skin plump and hydrated, while preventing signs of premature aging.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to your morning routine, you want to finish off your routine with an SPF. \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-everyday-sun-care-routine\"\u003eSun damage and oxidative stress can damage your skin’s protective barrier\u003c/a\u003e, leading to premature aging and causing your skin to look dull. You want to make sure to reapply your sunscreen throughout the day, as it typically only offers a few hours of protection. It’s also worth considering the impact of blue light damage on our skin. Siting in front of your laptop for six hours can cause as much damage as being in the mid-day sun for 25 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlong with maintaining a regular skincare routine to keep your skin hydrated, you want to add in extras like face masks. These treatments can help your overall self-care, as well as your skin. They’re easy to add in as an occasional treatment, whether it’s once a week or every few days. High-quality sheet masks will help the serum absorb into your skin for optimum results and can create a glass-like effect for your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Best Skincare Ingredients to Use\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to brighten your complexion and create a radiant glow, \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/heres-why-your-skin-needs-vitamin-c\"\u003eyou need vitamin C in your routine. \u003c/a\u003eThis ingredient has anti-inflammatory properties. It brightens your complexion by diminishing the appearance of redness in your skin, while smoothing its texture to create a dewy glow. Vitamin C also helps with whitening your skin by treating hyperpigmentation as it’s been proven to impede melanin production, which can cause dark spots and melasma on your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo keep your skin youthful and glowing, you want to incorporate \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/what-is-hyaluronic-acid-and-how-should-you-use-it\"\u003ehyaluronic acid\u003c/a\u003e. You can find this ingredient in serums or incorporated into moisturizers and facial creams. Hyaluronic acid is something you naturally find in your body, inside your connective tissue. It plays a role in your skin’s structure and is just as essential as collagen for keeping your skin looking youthful. Hyaluronic acid can hold up to thousand times its weight in water, helping to maintain your skin’s moisture [levels and boost your protective barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re highlighting these two ingredients because they can be used in partnership to create a dewy complexion. These two ingredients complement each other by hydrating and protecting your skin. Using vitamin C and hyaluronic acid together will reduce the risk of any irritation that might be triggered from the vitamin C by keeping your skin moisturised and aiding the healing process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eInvest in Skin Treatments\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile your skincare routine helps to care for your skin on a day-to-day basis, it sometimes needs a helping hand. Just like your skincare routine, the secret to experimenting with skincare treatments is to be consistent. Dermatologists typically recommend having a facial at least once a month. If you decide to choose a specialist treatment like plasma injections, your dermatologist will be able to recommend a course of sessions for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou don’t have to go to a spa or salon to indulge in a skin treatment.

These two tools are an affordable way of improving the overall condition of your skin. They work by promoting lymphatic drainage and stimulating your circulation to relax your muscles and detoxify your skin. Both a gua sha and jade roller will tone and lift your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAvoid Falling Asleep Wearing Your Makeup\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSometimes it happens. Maybe you’ve gotten in from work late and fallen asleep on the sofa. Whatever the reason, you don’t want to let it become a habit. Falling asleep with your makeup on can cause chaos for your skin by clogging your pores. It’s usually best to use an oil-based makeup remover if you use more pigmented beauty products, such as intense eyeshadow shades. While makeup wipes can stripe your skin of its moisture, it’s better to use makeup wipes if you’re in a rush than to let yourself fall asleep with your makeup on. If you wake up and remember you’ve got a face full of makeup on, you can double cleanse with a cleansing balm and a face wash.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGet Some Sleep\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe concept of ‘beauty sleep’ isn’t just an empty phrase. Getting eight hours of sleep can help reduce puffiness around your eyes and rejuvenate dull-looking skin. When you’re asleep, your skin has the chance to repair and renew itself on a cellular level. Sleeping better will improve your energy levels and boost your blood flow and circulation. When you’re dealing with sleep deprivation or insomnia, you start to suffer from blood flow issues that can give your skin a dull-looking appearance. When you have an increased blood flow to your face, you get the natural flush to your cheeks that accentuates your inner radiance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are your skincare goals?

The easier it is to purchase a product, the more sales you’ll generate as a brand. \u003cbr\u003eOn a livestream, your audience can purchase your products while interacting with you live. They can have the necessary peace of mind about the product before pulling out their wallets. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt Demands Less Resources\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou won’t need to invest as many resources in livestreams as you’d in an on-demand video. For a successful livestream, you’d just be needing a decent camera with a microphone, a device, a livestream software like Jumble.tv, and an audio mixer. \u003cbr\u003eVideo editing isn’t a requirement for livestreams. But, if you can do that as well, you’d reach more consumers, which can expand your reach on your next livestreams. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s More Engaging\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason why livestream shopping is blowing up is that it’s probably the most engaging content format. \u003cbr\u003eThe audience can interact with your brand and ask any questions they might have about your products. \u003cbr\u003eIt humanizes your brand and helps you form a more personal connection with prospective buyers and existing customers. \u003cbr\u003ePlus, you can make sure they get every information they need to make buying decisions without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAnyone Can Access it from Anywhere\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour prospects don’t need to switch their TVs ON to join your livestreams. They can access them from anywhere they want, through their mobile phones. \u003cbr\u003eThis allows you to reach a lot of prospects, making livestream shopping an effective strategy to boost sales. \u003cbr\u003eSo, the broad reach of livestream is another reason why it’s blowing up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt Has Proven to be Effective\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBefore China applied the concept of livestream shopping, it wasn’t known to produce any results. \u003cbr\u003eIt was only after Chinese eCommerce companies’ successful endeavor with livestream shopping that the rest of the world is following suit. \u003cbr\u003eIt’s a tried and tested method. Its effectiveness is evident from the fact that giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Instagram have introduced their own livestream platforms to engage the audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt’s Convenient and Easy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA livestream is easy to implement and manage. You don’t need many resources either.

A decent USB camera with 1080p screen resolution will do fine. \u003cbr\u003eThere are no added costs to running a livestream except when you are using an influencer as a host. \u003cbr\u003eThat too will bring in great ROI if you chose the right influencer for your brand. \u003cbr\u003ePlus, during a livestream, you can have more sales in a short period.

While eCommerce offers one-click purchases, your prospects can see the product in action before buying it on a livestream. \u003cbr\u003eFor instance, if you are a clothing brand, you can try them on and let the audience observe different aspects of the clothes. \u003cbr\u003eThe viewers can ask any questions they want about the products, which leads to a higher conversion rate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIt Uses Influencer Marketing\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInfluencer marketing is an effective way to generate sales. Doesn’t matter what type of business you are in, if you can find the right influencer, you can boost your sales. \u003cbr\u003eAs livestream shopping requires a host, you can ask a suitable influencer to do that for you. Just make sure to go with a micro-influencer that has previous experience in your niche. \u003cbr\u003eBy tapping into the audience of a particular influencer, you’d be multiplying your chances of getting conversions. This is because micro-influencers normally have a highly engaged following. Their audiences tend to trust them. \u003cbr\u003eSo, when they’d recommend your products to their audience, there is no reason why your sales won’t go up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIt Taps into Content Marketing\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere is a strong relation between livestream shopping and content marketing. Without powerful content, it would be quite difficult to sell to new audiences. \u003cbr\u003eUsing livestream shopping, brands help their audiences understand their industry, help them with using the products, and provide insights into the product selection process. \u003cbr\u003eHigh-value, user-centric content builds your trust with the audience, which, ultimately, leads to more sales. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, sales are what every brand out there is looking for. Everything revolves around getting more sales, be it brand awareness or brand identity. \u003cbr\u003eSo, as content marketing proves to be an effective form of marketing for driving sales, livestream shopping is also blowing up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere are quite a few reasons why livestream shopping is blowing up. For starters, it’s a great way to showcase your products as a brand and get sales. \u003cbr\u003eIt bridges the gap that eCommerce doesn’t: Providing the prospects an intimate connection with the product to help the sales process. \u003cbr\u003eMoreover, livestream shopping leverages the power of content marketing and influencer marketing. So, if you opt for livestream shopping as a brand, you’d be getting the benefits of both. \u003cbr\u003eIf you don’t know how to get started, Jumble.tv is effective software that lets you livestream to your audience with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

You’re spoilt for choice with comfortable one-piece suits and sexier silhouettes with a high cut. We’ve pulled together our\u003ca href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/swimsuit-trends-2022/slide5\"\u003e top swimsuit trends for summer 2022,\u003c/a\u003e so you can start your shopping early. With the sun about to come out, you can even take your new swimsuit to your backyard to work on your summer glow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHollywood Glamour\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you add a pair of oversized sunglasses and a coat of\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/the-most-iconic-red-lipstick-shades\"\u003e red lipstick\u003c/a\u003e to your look, you can double as a Hollywood start. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re jetting off to a five-star hotel or resort, you can carry the Hollywood glamour look through to the rest of your outfit. Add an oversized open cover-up to keep your shoulders covered from the sun. Instead of everyday flip-flops, why not add some sparkle to your footwear? Add a pair of heels to your look to give it a final touch of elevation. This look is one you’ll want to wear at the poolside bar when you’re sipping on cocktails and watching the sun set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat we love about this swimsuit is that it takes its inspiration from nightlife and the nightclub scene. It’s just the kind of swimsuit you could picture yourself wearing in a pool at a nightclub in Ibiza.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf sparkles aren’t your thing, and you prefer something more minimalistic, why not swap the gemstones out for a little shine? We love this swimsuit by \u003ca href=\"https://jadeswim.com/\"\u003eJADE Swim \u003c/a\u003ethat takes its inspiration from the ‘80s. The one-shoulder cut and rose gold colour gives it a contemporary feel with a timeless silhouette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAll Tied Up\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s anything that can make a two-piece bikini even sexier, it’s ties. A stringy bikini is an essential in every\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/the-jumblog/how-to-create-the-ultimate-capsule-closet-for-2021\"\u003e woman’s closet.\u003c/a\u003e Adding a few strings makes a bikini work for any body time. If you’ve got curves, the straps will help accentuate your natural shape. Curvy women commonly assume they can’t wear a bikini, when the opposite is true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne benefit from this style that everyone can take advantage of is the adjustable straps, which you can move and change to suit your body type and desired look. With a stringy bikini, you’ll be able to find a style that works for you and your silhouette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can take this\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/trends\"\u003e trend \u003c/a\u003eone step further by adding a retro print, one of the other biggest trends for 2022. The adjustable strings on the side of this two-piece by Zimmerman gives added versatility to the swimsuit. You can lift the strings to create a high-waisted look or cinch them in to make your hips appear smaller. What we also love about this specific bikini is that the adjustable straps also appear on the cleavage, making it easier to personalise your swimsuit – whether you’d rather cover up or show off your assets. If retro isn’t your thing, you can try this animal print bikini by Lisa Marie Fernandez to bring out your wild side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRibbed One Piece\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA classic one-piece swimsuit is a summer staple. You’ll never want to go on a vacation or a trip to the beach without one. With a versatile one-piece, you can double the swimsuit up as a top and wear denim shorts for a beach goddess look. If shorts aren’t your thing, you can swap it out for a ruffle skirt. The versatility of a one-piece swimsuit means you can wear it underneath just about any summer outfit. If anyone happens to see it, they’ll think it’s a vest top. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis trend is a must-try for summer because it gives you both style and functionality. Ribbed swimsuits have an extra stretch that means you can keep it in your closet for years to come. It’s worth the splurge, as it can grow with you. If you’re looking for a maternity swimsuit, a ribbed one-piece is the perfect way to keep cool at the beach while keeping your bump protected from the sun. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother group of people who can benefit from a ribbed swimsuit is those that play water sports or volleyball. A ribbed swimsuit will move with you and adapt to your body as you move. If you’re someone who loves to run along the beach or build up a sweat while out surfing, a ribbed one-piece will see you through just about anything. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe classic colour for a ribbed one piece is white – as it gives you added versatility. Plus, it’s the perfect base colour to show off your fresh summer glow. We love this style by \u003ca href=\"https://www.hunzag.com/\"\u003eHunza G\u003c/a\u003e as it features a cross cross back, which lifts and supports your bust, while helping to hold you in and accentuate your curves. With a little styling, you can take this swimsuit from the beach to cocktails with your friends. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re in the market for a ribbed one piece, it’s best to stick to classic neutral tones that you can mix and match with other summer staples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCut Out Swimsuit\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe cut-out trend is everywhere that you look in the \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/fashion\"\u003efashion industry\u003c/a\u003e, and it’s made its way into the swimsuit world. If you’ve spent lockdown working on your fitness goals, a cut-out swimsuit will let you show off your gains and toned abs. The cut out silhouette can give a classic swimsuit a more contemporary feel. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re tired of wearing the same swimsuit every season, choosing the style with a cut-out can refresh your summer closet. You can show off some extra skin – making this a must-have for anyone planning a couple’s getaway or if you want to catch a few eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe love this creative swimsuit by \u003ca href=\"https://www.patbo.com.br/beachwear?O=OrderByReleaseDateDESC\"\u003ePatBO\u003c/a\u003e, which uses a chiffon-trimmed halter neck swimsuit and updates the style with both a cut-out and bold sleeves. You can take the swimsuit from day to night by slipping on a pair of tailored pants and your favourite wedge espadrilles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne thing you’ll want to consider with this style is whether you’re going to be tanning. The last thing you want is tan lines around the cut-outs. If you’re wearing a cut-out swimsuit at the beach, you’ll want to make sure you apply an extra layer of\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/sales/gel-creme-solaire-spf50\"\u003e SPF around the cut-out areas to keep your skin protected.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHula Hoops\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most classic styles of swimsuit is the hula hoop. This vintage-inspired swimsuit is back in vogue. It’s a look that’s stood the test of time and is a great option if you want to invest in a swimsuit that you can wear for a few seasons. The hula hoops naturally flatter your shape and the classic silhouette of the swimsuit. If you struggle to keep your bikini top in place, the hula hoop can lift your bikini and keep everything in place. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking at bikinis, you can mix and match the top and bottoms for a personalised look. If you’re opting for a hula hoop bikini top, you can balance out your look with a high-waisted bikini bottom to accentuate your figure and pull you in. \u003ca href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/fr-fr/shop/createurs/agua-by-agua-bendita?cm_mmc=GoogleFR%E2%80%94c-_-NAP_FR_FR-_-NAP+-+INTL+-+FR+-+FR+-+DSA+-+Other+Designers-_-DSA+-+All-_-DYNAMIC+SEARCH+ADS__dsa-1636748900098_INTL\u0026gclid=Cj0KCQjwnNyUBhCZARIsAI9AYlGfGtXaHqsdY1XtIwAKgb_femJ6M3-0IUPXtbjaxqzDreiaagYBkBQaAhyeEALw_wcB\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds\"\u003eAgua by Agua Bendita\u003c/a\u003e, who handmake their swimsuits. If you’re heading to the poolside bar, you can add a coverup or sarong to finish off your look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can still jump on the hula hoop trend with a one-piece. Instead of the circular shape appearing on the top half, you’ll usually see it used as a belt to cinch in your waist. The circular motif of the hula hoop one-piece updates the silhouette and can make your swimsuit appear more expensive and elevated. This trend is a must-try for anyone who likes a classic with a vintage twist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these swimsuit trends will you be trying out for summer 2021?

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003e2020 was the year that street style went digital. Instead of fashion photographers being able to snap photos of fashionistas on their way to Fashion Week, Instagram and TikTok took centre stage. While this means that street style – in its purest form – was put on hold – it doesn’t mean we weren’t treated to a few trends during the pandemic. With the world starting to open back up again, you can expect to see a return to street style on your social media feeds. We’re waiting to see if the pandemic trends will carry through, or if people will turn to more glamorous pieces.\u003cbr\u003eFrom what we did see during fashion week, it’s clear that casual clothing was the predominant trend. There was a mix of elevated and basic pieces, like blazers and jeans, with a pair of classic sneakers added in for an activewear twist. One trend that we loved was the prominence of silk and midi dresses with sensible footwear, primarily sneakers and slides. The street style that we saw in 2021 was a blend of vintage and contemporary pieces, with a focus on conscious fashion choices.\u003cbr\u003eAfter a year of wearing loungewear and sweatpants, everyone is ready for a return to more tailored pieces. It’s time we replace our shapeless lounge pants with clothes that accentuate our curves. Within a few months, we’ll be back to watching celebrities, influencers, and fashion editors showing off their street style as they head to a sold-out show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough we’re still waiting for street style to make its full return post-pandemic, we thought it was the perfect time to have a look at what you can expect from the genre when the world returns to normal. We’ve drawn up our list by looking at the pieces worn by the lucky few who attended shows in person, as well as the trends we’re seeing on social media. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re thinking of giving your closet a refresh as we leave lockdown, these are the pieces to keep an eye out for. While some are specific items, others are overarching trends that you can incorporate into your closet in your own way. Get ahead of the curve and update your closet before these items sell out.\u003cbr\u003eThese are the nine trends that we’re expecting to see when street style returns (hopefully!) in the next few months:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBubblegum Pink\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one feminine colour that we’re seeing everywhere right now, it’s bubblegum pink. While there’s other colours like mellow yellow that are trending, bubblegum pink is the colour we expect to see most in street style during 2021. It’s a colour that you can have fun with, whether you want to incorporate it into your garments or keep it as an accessory colour. You can use it to add a feminine touch to your outfit or to create a pop of neon to juxtapose against the neutral colours of your look. \u003cbr\u003eBubblegum pink is a colour that will turn heads, and photograph beautifully. We expect to see everyone stepping out with at least one bubblegum pink piece post-pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCutout Dresses\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs much as we love a classic silhouette, after a awhile, they can start to feel boring and uninspiring. Cutouts are a risky fashion choice, giving you an opportunity to flash a little skin and show off your abs. Cutouts come in every shape and form, whether it’s a small one in the front of the dress, or a larger cut out at the back. \u003cbr\u003eWe think the cutout dresses are going to be a street style staple for 2021 because they give you the opportunity to take a timeless silhouette and give it a contemporary twist by changing up the look of the dress. Whether it’s a little black dress or a silky white spaghetti strap, you’ll see cutouts on every classic dress type.\u003cbr\u003eIf dresses aren’t for you, you can incorporate the cutout trend into your closet with a more subtle not through shirts and jumpers. If you prefer a slightly more modest look, you can opt for a cutout neckline sweater for the most understated look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFlower Power\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the cottagecore trend and shows like Bridgerton, we’ve all discovered a newfound appreciation for ‘tacky’ florals. The sort of floral print you would expect to see in your grandma’s house. The more 80s the floral print looks, the better! Whether this trend will make it into this year’s street style looks will depend on how quickly restrictions are lifted during the summer. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re thinking of experimenting with these floral prints, stick to feminine silhouettes like midi dresses and shirts with a puff sleeve. If you’re going to make the floral print the centre point of your outfit, you either want to wear it from head-to-toe, or balance it out with a classic colour like blue wash denim.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOversized Trousers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile we don’t expect sweatpants to be our go-to choice after the pandemic, we think the relaxed silhouette will stay around for a while. After all, Gen Z has cancelled skinny jeans, and no one wants to force themselves into trousers that are too tight to breathe. Another reason we expect the oversized trousers to become a street style trend is because of the rise of the ‘dark academia’ fashion aesthetic across social media, with these elevated basics taking on a life of their own. You can decide how oversized or flared-out you want your trousers to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStrappy Sandals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBottega Veneta is one brand that was dominating the world of street style before we were forced into lockdown. The brand’s popularity has continued to grow during the pandemic. Their strappy sandals have led to us all having a look at our summer footwear. The asymmetric straps and toe-ring detailing gives these sandals a more complicated structure that is both minimalistic but inventive. Keep an eye out for styles that use only a few straps, but that give you both comfort and style.\u003cbr\u003eThis style of shoe elongates your legs with ‘barely there’ straps, creating a streamline look from the hem of your skirt to your toes. If you’re opting for this street style trend, don’t forget to book in for a pedicure to finish off your look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCheckerboard Print\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe’d like to thank Netflix’s Queen’s Gambit for reminding us of our love for checker print. What makes street style unique is the fact people aren’t afraid to wear a bold or daring people that is eye catching and demands attention. It’s what makes street wear photography so attractive and allows the subject to stand out against the normality of the background. Designers and brands at every level are incorporating the checkerboard print into their new collections. \u003cbr\u003eWhile classic black and white checkerboard is our favourite, we’re seeing more pinks and greens appearing as pastel alternatives. With this trend, you can wear the print from head-to-toe with a maxi dress or break it up with separate pieces. Depending on the colour you choose for your checkerboard, you can usually style it with neutral and earth-tone shades. You can take the black from the checkerboard and carry it through to your accessories to tie your look together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDresses and Leggings\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother street style trend that we think is going to evolve from activewear is legging layering. Several of the attendees to the virtual Prada F/1 21 Menswear show incorporated leggings into their looks. With modest fashion also on the rise, we’re expecting to see more people incorporating leggings into their looks to cover up. Whether it’s under a puffy dress or with a white crisp skirt, it’s clear that leggings are about to make a comeback for streetwear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eStatement Tights\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhether it’s the monogram Gucci tights or a simple neon pair, this accessory is about to make a return to the street style world. This trend comes from Japan, whose street style has been reinventing the classic day dress and making it more wearable by adding extra layers. Adding statement tights can bring a contemporary feel to a classic or timeless silhouette.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to refresh your street style look without breaking the bank, look for accessories like statement tights that you can incorporate into your look on a budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSpots On\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor Spring/Summer 2021, polka dots have made a reappearance in street style. Polka dots are an easy way to add something fun and elegant into your look. Depending on your aesthetic, you can take the polka dot trend and use it for a sartorial look, or channel your inner Sophia Loren with a classic look. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re thinking of adding polka dots to your street style looks for 2021, you can incorporate the silk trend by looking for garments made of the material. A silk polka dot dress is one that any street style aficionado would be able to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich trends do you expect to see in street style post-pandemic?

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eMost of us think our beauty routine starts when we sit down at our vanity. You’ve jumped in the shower to wash the sleep away and grabbed your clothes for the day. By the time you get to your vanity, you’re ready for your morning coffee and an extra dose of caffeine. Instead of starting your beauty routine when you get to your vanity, you want to start it when you jump in the shower. Not only does it save you precious minutes in the morning, but it can be a gamechanger for your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis last year has all been about upgrading your skincare routine. With nowhere to go during COVID, we’ve shifted our focus from doing our makeup to skincare. After all, who doesn’t want a dewy glow? Changing how you think about your morning shower can help you elevate your routine and get the most out of your beauty routine. We’re sharing all the secrets about perfecting your in-shower beauty routine and how to get glowing skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Benefits of Warm Water\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you jump under the steam of your shower, you can instantly feel the stress leave your shoulders. If you’re stressing about your day at work or feel anxious about your ‘to do’ list, a shower is the best way to start your day. Research from the European Society of Medicine has shown that the heat of the water stimulates your blood circulation quicker and more efficiently than any kind of dry heat. By boosting your blood circulation, warm water helps your skin retain its elasticity and collagen, preventing premature aging. Keeping your skin youthful is the best way to maintain your natural glow. \u003cbr\u003eThere are a few things you want to consider about your in-shower routine so that you can get the most out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eConsider the Temperature\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eGetting the right temperature will make or break your shower routine. As tempting as it is to turn your water to the hottest setting, it can strip the natural oils from your skin and damage your skin’s natural protective barrier. When this barrier is damaged, your skin is more at-risk to free radical and sun damage, along with moisture loss. If the water is too high, the same thing can happen with your scalp and cause your hair to become dehydrated and prone to breakage. \u003cbr\u003eLukewarm water is your skin and hair’s best friend. When the temperature is warm (without being too hot!) you can enjoy all the benefits of warm water without dehydrating your skin. If a roasting hot shower is a staple of your routine that you can’t do without, limit your time in the shower to less than five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo a Mask + Massage\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe steam and humidity of your shower makes it the perfect environment to indulge in a face mask. Your skin is able to better absorb the active ingredients in your face mask, giving you the best bang for your buck. One ingredient you want to incorporate into your shower routine is vitamin C, which will brighten your complexion, boost your collagen production, and protect your skin from free radical damage. \u003cbr\u003eThe best type of mask to choose from your shower is a cleansing mask that will remove dead skin cells and impurities from your skin. Doing a mask in the shower will kickstart your skincare routine. You can let the mask sit and develop on your skin as you apply your shampoo to your hair or add a leave-in conditioner. \u003cbr\u003eOnce you’ve rinsed off your mask, grab your faithful gua sha. While this is everyone’s favourite facial massage tool, you can get the best results in the shower. A gua sha helps your lymphatic drainage and reduces puffiness in your skin, helping to wake you up first thing in the morning. The heat of the water helps the gua sha slip along your skin, so you don’t have to worry about dragging it across your face. \u003cbr\u003eThe best way to use a gua sha is to press it down against your skin and gently stroke it across your face. Don’t forget your neck! You want to move outwards from the centre of your face for one minute to get the best results. You can wave your sleepy face goodbye and say hello to a brighter glow. A mask and massage is a way of making everyone think you got eight hours of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Forget Your Body\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen we think of our beauty routine, we often focus on our face. The shower is the perfect place to focus on your body. One of the biggest trends in skincare is body brushing. If you have sensitive or mature skin, you want to do your dry brushing in the shower, as the water acts as a lubricant to prevent skin irritation or inflammation.\u003cbr\u003eYou can think of wet body brushing as a ‘double cleanse’ for your body. If you’re someone who wears fake tan, this is a must-have to help you get an even colour by removing dead skin cells. If you want a more luxurious experience, add a couple of drops of a hydrating body oil to the brush, moving in circular motions over your skin. \u003cbr\u003eWhile you’re working on your legs, swap between cold and warm water. Cold water will give your internal organs a rush of blood to rejuvenate your system, while warm water will help bring oxygen to your skin, lifting nutrient-rich blood to the surface to tighten your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eInvest in a Body Oil\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile we all use a shower gel in the morning, you can give your skin some TLC with a body oil. It adds an extra layer of hydration to your skin, especially areas of your body that you usually forget about. With so much focus on our face, we often forget about keeping the rest of our body hydrated. If you have dry skin, this step is a must-have for your beauty routine. You’ll see a difference almost right away. \u003cbr\u003eInvest in a body oil with a natural fragrance to reduce irritation to your skin. You want to apply it everywhere from your neck to ankles while the water is still running. It should be the last step for your body care routine. \u003cbr\u003ePro tip! When you get out of the shower, you want to pat dry instead of rubbing a harsh towel against your skin. If you wrap your body in a towel and pat downwards, you can negatively impact your skin’s elastin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGive Your Hair Some TLC\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe steam of the shower will help your hair products penetrate deeper into the hair follicles. It’ll give your hair a little extra moisture, making it perfect for coarse or curly hair. If you have fine hair, it’s a good idea to just apply your conditioner to th ends of your hair. \u003cbr\u003eWhatever your hair type is, give your scalp a gentle exfoliation using a hair mask to lift the dirt and product residue from your scalp. The steam of the shower makes your pores more pliable. This stage of your in-shower beauty routine is when the water should be at its hottest. As the steam opens the hair cuticles, it allows your products to work overtime to give you the best results. \u003cbr\u003eInstead of standing directly under the water, you want to let your hair soak in the steam. The best way to apply your mask or conditioner is to section off your hair and layer the product. \u003cbr\u003eIf you have the time, add an oil-based treatment to your hair to give it a natural shine. You want to try and leave it on for five minutes before rinsing, giving you time to shave or dry brush your body. \u003cbr\u003eDoing this process can help reduce frizz in your hair and give your girls more definition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAfter The Shower\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOnce you’re out of the shower, it’s time to pick-up your beauty routine. As you’ve already cleansed your skin, you can jump back into the rest of your skincare routine. Use a hydrating toner to catch any left-over dead skin cells on your face. You can boost the vitamin C that you used in the shower by adding another vitamin-rich serum to your routine. If you have drier skin, vitamin E is the perfect choice for a morning serum to plump your skin.\u003cbr\u003eIf you struggle with dark undereye circles, you can apply a few drops around the eye area. This stage of your skincare routine is a great opportunity to incorporate a jade roller to help tighten your skin and boost the effects of the gua sha. Finish off your skincare routine with a moisturizer to seal in all the active ingredients you used in your shower products. As it’s your morning regime, you want to add on an SPF to keep your skin protected from sun damage. \u003cbr\u003eAfter your skincare is done, you can follow-up with your makeup routine and style your hair before heading out the door. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you start your beauty routine in the shower?

Those that were pro ‘socks and slides’, against those who thought it was a fashion sin. Fast forward a few years – and the combo has become one of the biggest trends for spring/summer 2021. Why is this? You just have to look at the rise of ‘dad’ fashion, fuelled by Birkenstocks and Chanel sandals. While we once thought of this look as something your dad would wear on a foreign holiday, everyone from Kylie Jenner to Rihanna and Justin Bieber are rocking the trend. \u003cbr\u003eYou can think of the trend as ‘off-the-clock supermodel chic’ with an athleisure twist. This combo is a popular choice for wearing with athleisure or while travelling. If you’re heading to the airport, socks and sandals can keep you comfortable, whether you’re booked into business class or economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe secret to nailing the sock and sandal trend is to know how to mix and match them together. Pairing the wrong socks with your sandals can make you stick out like a sore thumb. This trend is one we plan on rocking all summer long. Our guide shares 8 simple sock and sandal pairings that you can easily recreate throughout the summer. Grab a pen and write down the sock styles that you’ll need to grab on your next shopping trip.\u003cbr\u003eDo you need to grab a pair of sandals first? We have a dedicate guide to the sandals you need in your closet, including all the latest styles for spring/summer 2021. Whether you’re working from home or hitting the shops, these socks and sandal pairings can take you anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Rise of Sock and Sandals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes the sock and sandal trend so appealing is that you can personalise it to your aesthetic. There are no hard or fast rules that you have to stick to. In fact, you can usually mix and match pieces that are already in your closet. This trend is a way to update your look without breaking the bank. You can make the look preppy or give it a sporty twist depending on your combo of choice. This trend is one that anyone can jump on, whether you’re a busy stay-at-home mum or a college student cramping for their finals. \u003cbr\u003eOne thing you want to consider what this trend is that your socks are going to be on view just as much as your shoes. Make sure you have a fresh pair that doesn’t have any holes (it happens!) or look too dog-eared. If you think this trend is going to become a staple look for you, it’s a good idea to keep a few pairs strictly for wearing with your sandals for a sleek look.\u003cbr\u003eYou can wear this trend all year long. If you’re someone who loves sandals but hates the idea of cold feet or getting caught in a rainstorm, socks can help you wear your sandals 365 days a year. Even when the sun comes up, you can stick to your socks. After all, you might forget to give yourself a pedicure but still want to rock your new sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 1 – Comfortable Cotton Socks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWearing sandals can be uncomfortable for your feet. The strap can dig into your skin and might struggle to get a proper grip on the sole of your sandals. If this sounds like you, a pair of socks can make your sandals more comfortable. It’s worth investing in a pair of cotton socks that will make it feel like you’re walking on a cloud. If comfort is your aim, you can keep your sock-sandal combo simplistic with a pair of classic leather sandals with minimalistic hardware.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re planning to walk for a long distance – especially in the sunlight – adding comfortable socks can make the experience easier on your feet and reduce any bad smells by absorbing the moisture and sweat from your feet.\u003cbr\u003eThis look is the perfect opportunity to add a little monogram to your look. The rise of this trend has led everyone from Gucci to Versace coming out with monogram socks. They’re a splurge purchase that you’ll want to save for days when you can show them after. Why would you break the bank with Gucci socks if you can’t put them in the spotlight?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 2 – Add a Pop of Colour\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone wants to wear a bold pair of shoes. Black, white, and tan are the most popular colours for sandals of every style. If you’re looking to experiment with colours and give your look a quirky twist, you can take your minimalistic sandals and add a colourful sock. If you have white or black sandals, they’ll work with any colour. \u003cbr\u003eTo make a statement with your socks, you want to try and keep the rest of your look monochrome and within the same colour scheme as your sandals. You can let your socks take centre stage. If you want to give your closet a summer refresh, you can choose a trending colour like magenta purple or pastel pink for your socks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 3 – Platforms and Pink Socks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003ePlatform sandals are the perfect way to bring the sandal trend to your nightclub look. If you’re someone who has to have a few extra inches of height, platform sandals are your BFF. This silhouette gives the sandals a more feminine look, which is where the inspiration for our third pairing comes from. Don’t be afraid to embrace your inner girly-girl and pink socks to your look.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re a fan of the cottagecore aesthetic – or have binge watched Netflix’s Bridgerton – you can swap these out for a pair of classic socks with a frill detailing. The frills will add a classic touch to balance out the platform in your sandals. If you choose socks with grills around the top, you can tuck your socks over the ankle strap of your platforms for a sleeker look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 4 – Sporty Spice\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe sandal and sock trend got its start thanks to the slides, which makes this combination one of the most recognisable on this list. You want to make it look like you’re heading to your yoga class or have just finished weightlifting. If you want to nail this look, choose sandals that feature velcro or a rubber sole. You can even choose a pair with a monogram twist if you want to give your look an athleisure feel. \u003cbr\u003eThe best socks to choose for a sporty look are the same style you would wear to the gym or with your everyday sneakers. Keep it simple with grey socks or your favourite pair of Nike socks. Don’t overthink the sporty combo. The more minimalistic, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 5 – Tie-Dye\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one trend we love to incorporate into every look, it’s the tie-dye trend. Most of us spent the start of the pandemic tie-dying everything we could get our hands on. If you’re looking for a budget friendly sock and sandal pairing, this is the one for you. Take an old pair of socks and follow a DIY tie-dye tutorial to give your socks a new look. You can keep it simple with a black and white monochrome or think outside the box with your favourite colours. \u003cbr\u003eFor tie-dye socks, you want to try and keep your sandals as simple as possible, so you don’t have a colour clash. Keep it classic with black or white sandals. If you want to show off your tie-dye socks, opt for a pair of open-back sandals to get the full effect of your tie-dye look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 6 – Sweet and Simple\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of this pairing is that it naturally elongates your legs and gives the illusions that your socks and sandals are an all-in-one shoe. You want to choose socks that are as close to the colour of your sandals as possible for this look. You can keep it simple with black socks and sandals or give it a summer-time twist with a pastel pairing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 7 – Subtle Shading\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re not a fan of being too matchy-matchy, this pairing is the perfect alternative. Instead of choosing socks and sandals that are the exact same shade, you can add definition to your look by adding socks that are a few hues lighter or darker than your sandals. If your sandals are a more unique colour, it can save you searching high and low for an exact match.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCombo 8 – Experiment with Yellow\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhite socks and sandals may look nice on your Instagram page, but it can be a nightmare when you’re out and about. If you’re worried about getting dirt on your sandals, swap out the pairing for a yellow duo. Sunshine yellow is one of the trending colours for spring/summer 2021, and it can add a softer aesthetic to your outfit. Your socks and sandals don’t have to be an exact match, and you can keep it simple with cotton socks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhich of these sock and sandal pairings are your favourite?

		"post-summary": "Wearing socks and sandals together has long divided the fashion community. When slides made their comeback in 2016, the internet was divided between two camps. Those that were pro ‘socks and slides’, against those who thought it was a fashion sin. Fast forward a few years – and the combo has become one of the biggest trends for spring/summer 2021. Why is this? You just have to look at the rise of ‘dad’ fashion, fuelled by Birkenstocks and Chanel sandals. While we once thought of this look as something your dad would wear on a foreign holiday, everyone from Kylie Jenner to Rihanna and Justin Bieber are rocking the trend. ",

In this article, you’ll know about all the things you need for an engaging and impactful livestream. \u003cbr\u003eWe’ll be discussing the equipment, software, platform, and strategy in this article. So, this article is all you need to read if you are thinking of using livestream to grow your business. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eLet’s get started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA High-quality Camera\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough you can use a mobile camera to livestream on any platform, a high-quality dedicated camera is a better choice for businesses. \u003cbr\u003eA camera is the most important part of your livestream. The visual quality of your stream gives the first impression to your viewers. \u0026nbsp; \u003cbr\u003eYou don’t want your audience to have a bad impression of your business, right?\u003cbr\u003eFor livestreams, the most common type of camera is a USB webcam that connects with your laptop/desktop. \u003cbr\u003eIf you can’t find a stable surface for the camera, a tripod stand will do the trick. Just make sure you get a webcam with at least 1080p resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA Laptop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou’d need a laptop that can deliver your livestream smoothly. Any modern laptop would suffice as livestreaming isn’t a highly intensive task. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, it does require good RAM and a processor. So, make sure you get a laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and an i7 processor. You’d also want to have maximum USB ports to connect other devices to your laptop. \u003cbr\u003eIf portability isn’t important to you, a desktop computer would be a great choice too. In fact, desktops are even better as they offer more USB ports; you can also improve their specifications later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA Mic with Noise Reduction Capability\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe audio quality is another key element of a livestream. Without clear and crisp audio, most of your users will lose interest in what you have to say. \u003cbr\u003eFind a mic with noise-reduction capability. You don’t want background noise causing distraction. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eYou can get a good wireless mic as well if you want to move around in your livestream.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAudio Mixer\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAn audio mixer will allow you to use multiple sound sources in your livestream. Plus, it lets you adjust the audio volume of multiple mics. \u003cbr\u003eThe key aspect to look for in an audio mixer is the number of audio inputs. Will you be livestreaming as a team? Or would you want to have guests join your livestreams? \u003cbr\u003eGenerally, look for an audio mixer that has multiple outputs and good audio adjustment features. \u003cbr\u003eAlso, look for the one that connects with a laptop via a USB port.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA Livestream Software \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe software is where all the magic happens. It puts you in front of your audience. Plus, it allows you to use transitions and overlays over your livestreams. \u003cbr\u003eFor instance, you can put your logo and other graphics over your livestreams. \u003cbr\u003eThe level of sophistication and professionalism you’d need as a business requires the use of professional livestream software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA High-speed, Stable Internet Connection\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInternet is the medium that connects you with your prospects. And, interruption in livestreams is mostly because of unstable internet connections. \u003cbr\u003eSo, it’s important to have a high-bandwidth, stable internet connection to let things go according to plan. \u003cbr\u003eEven better would be a wired internet connection. Wi-Fi connections are more prone to disruptions. \u003cbr\u003eMake sure your internet is working smoothly before going live. Lastly, we recommend doing livestreams with a bandwidth between 3 and 5 Mbps speeds. \u003cbr\u003eThat was all about the equipment and software. Now comes the trickier part. Let’s see what you’d need for your livestream to be highly effective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEngaging Content \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe content of your livestream is without a doubt the key to its success. As a business, you can’t just go live. You need a topic to talk about. \u003cbr\u003eYou’d need engaging content to keep the audience with you. Your content shouldn’t be boring. You don’t want to let your audience leave the livestream. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eSo, deliver your message in an engaging and interesting way. Interact with your audience, encourage them to ask questions, and address them with patience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA Helping Hand\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou don’t want to go live without a team member having your back. While you can make sure everything goes according to plan, livestreams tend to be unexpected. \u003cbr\u003eYou might need water during the livestream. You may run into a problem that you don’t know the solution to. \u003cbr\u003eSo, make sure to have a helping hand beside you so that you don’t get distracted from the livestream.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eVideo Management\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMany of your prospects may not end up watching a livestream. And, many may also want to watch it later. \u003cbr\u003eAsk your viewers to drop their suggestions and questions in the comments section. Respond to their queries even after the livestream has ended. \u003cbr\u003eWith your livestream saved as an on-demand video, you’ll attract more viewers to your future livestreams. \u003cbr\u003eSo, keeping your livestreams as a video is also important. Consider keeping the recording on the platform and use a video editing tool to cut out any unnecessary parts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDelivering a livestream requires a few tools and strategies. You need the right equipment and software to make your livestreams impactful. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, your content should be engaging and valuable for your target audience. Interact with them, encourage them to ask questions, and address them effectively. \u003cbr\u003eLastly, keeping your livestream as a video can multiply your viewers. Most of your target audience may miss your livestream. Keep it for the audience that may want to watch your livestream later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

Everyone is chasing the ideal of a ‘hot girl summer’, meaning that we all have to step up our makeup game. It’s time to dig around for your favourite bold lipstick, book in for a lash lift, and splurge on a new eyeshadow palette. With the end of lockdown coming just in time for summer, you can expect this summer to be unlike any other. \u003cbr\u003eWhile this list focuses on makeup trends, you don’t want to forget about your skincare. During the summer, it’s more important than ever to be on top of your skincare routine. You need to protect your skin from sun damage, which means touching up your sunscreen throughout the day. \u003cbr\u003eYou can interpret these summer trends to meet your personal preference. Summer makeup tends to fall into two categories – natural and full glam. Some people prefer to go as minimalistic as possible to let their summer tan shine through and to avoid their makeup sweating. If you fall into this category, you want to focus on levelling up your skincare routine and focusing on lip stains and two-in-one products. \u003cbr\u003eWhile glam is something you can wear all year round, this summer is different. After a year of barely wearing makeup, most of us are counting down the days until we can have an excuse to wear a full face of makeup. One thing you’ll want to consider if you’re going for full glam, is the reality of wearing a face mask. \u003cbr\u003eWhether you’re a fan of natural makeup to avoid your makeup sweating in the sun, or if you’re going full glam, this guide is for you. We’ve pulled together all the top trends for summer 2021, so you know which essentials to grab before the temperatures skyrocket. You’ll want at least one of each of these staples in your summer makeup bag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSignature Red Lipstick\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIs there anything more classic than a red lipstick? It’s a summer staple for nights on the town or first dates. You can give your red lipstick a tropical twist by choosing a shade with orange undertones. If you’re planning to wear your red lipstick under your face mask, make sure to set the lipstick with a translucent powder to avoid it smudging all over your mask.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re a fan of long-wearing formulas, choose a liquid lipstick that can take you from day to night. You can jump on the natural beauty bandwagon and choose a lip stain for a ‘just kissed’ look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBerry Blush\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe usually think of ballerina pink or a magenta shade as the go-to shade for summer. For summer 2021, it’s all about berry shades. With masks hiding the lower half of your face, you want to show off your cheeks and cheekbones with a deep blush. Look out for shades like rose, raspberry, or pinks with red undertones. Don’t be afraid about making it look too blended, as the berry blush trend comes from the 80s resurgence. \u003cbr\u003eIf you’re a fan of mixing and matching your makeup products, you can usually find 2-in-1 blush and lip stains. You can coordinate your lips and cheeks, while enjoyable a sheer and buildable colour for a custom finish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGo Full Glam\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor most of 2020, our makeup bags sat gathering dust. With the world opening up again, it’s time to refine your makeup skills and experiment with full glam. While this will mean something different to each person, you want to make sure you’re paying attention to each of your features. Blended eyeshadow. Winged eyeliner. Glossy lips. Sculpted cheekbones. The list goes on.\u003cbr\u003eDuring summer 2021, you can wear full glam makeup anywhere. One thing you’ll want to consider is whether you’ll have to wear a mask while you’re out-and-about. If you’re going to be wearing one, it’s a good idea to invest in a setting spray and translucent powder to prevent your makeup smudge. You’ll also want to keep a concealer or powder on hand for touch-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFluffy Soap Brows\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAgain, you can thank the pandemic for this summer 2021 trend. While eyebrows naturally frame your face, they’re even more important when you’re going out and about with a face mask on.\u003cbr\u003eYou can prep your eyebrows for the season by booking in for a brow lamination or micro-pigmentation appointment to give you flawless brows all summer long. If you prefer to do your brows at home, keep a clear gel or a brow wax in your makeup bag for regular touch-ups. The soap brow trend shows no signs of slowing down, with brands now releasing their own custom brow soap to help tame and groom your stubborn eyebrow hairs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eJuicy Lips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDo you remember the juicy lips of the early 2000s? Like all things from the era, they’re back with a bang. You can go back to Lancome for their OG Juicy Tube lip gloss. These glosses are a perfect alternative to liquid lipstick or bolder shades. You can use a clear or light pink gloss to help brighten your complexion and give your lips a dewy glow. Make sure to blot your gloss before putting on your mask!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePastel Eyeshadows\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWith all this mask wearing, the one area of your makeup where you can get inventive is your eyes. As your mask covers the lower half of your face, all eyes are on your top half. Don’t be afraid to experiment with eyeshadow shades and take a risk. Go outside your comfort zone this summer and pick up a pastel palette. Dior has focused their summer 2021 makeup collection on purple shades, with a flash of mellow yellow and champagne gold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHydration, Hydration, Hydration\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one thing that we’re committed to doing in summer 2021, it’s maintaining our skincare routine. You want to fill your makeup bag with hydrating products that will keep your skin protected from the sun and give you a dewy glow. When your skin is healthy and hydrated, you can opt for skin tints instead of foundation. Don’t forget your sunscreen and body lotion. If you’re planning on going ‘all natural’ this summer, you’ll want to shift your focus to hydrating products that will leave your skin looking plump and healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDramatic Eyeliner\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis summer, we’ve got a lot to catch up on. What is usually considered to be ‘winter’ eyeliner – smoky shadows and dramatic eyeliner – has found its way into the summer trends. It’s time to practice your cat-eye liner and perfect your waterline. If you want to give your eyeliner a fun summer twist, you can opt for a bold or pastel shade instead of a traditional black liner.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to experiment with eyeliner without going too OTT, you can create a similar silhouette but with a thinner line. Eyeliner will add a sultry feel to your look and help widen your eyes. For days when you’re wearing eyeliner without shadow, add a touch of foundation or concealer to act as a base to prevent your liner from smudging.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePretty in Pink\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe colour of the summer 2021 is pastel pink. In fact, it’s pastel pink everything. When it comes to makeup, you have fifty shades of pink to choose from. The best way of incorporating them into your makeup look is to choose different hues and finish. You might do a wash of a rose gold pink over your eyes, before adding ballerina pink to your cheeks. The lips will be the most noticeable pink shade – with a stain or liquid lipstick being your best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFull Lashes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother eye-focused makeup trend for summer 2021 is your eyelashes. The longer the lashes, the better. Just like your eyebrows, you can choose to treat yourself to a treatment or opt for a budget-friendly at-home alternative. If you want to streamline your beauty routine, you can invest in eyelash extensions so that you always wake up with curled and voluminous lashes. When you’re in for your appointment, you can add-on a lash lift for extra definition. If you’d rather wear mascara, you can opt for just the lash lift by itself.\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone who isn’t comfortable with going into a salon just yet, you can purchase a lash serum to help your eyelashes lengthen and before thicker. If you’re not a serum fan, you can go back to the tried and tested eyelash curler to lift and lengthen your lashes.\u003cbr\u003eIf you like to stick to the basics, buy yourself a new voluminous mascara for the same effects. Everyone from Revlon to Charlotte Tilbury has recently released new mascaras, so you’re guaranteed to be able to find a well-performing one within your beauty budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of the summer 2021 makeup trends is your favourite?

Not only will you save a few pennies, you’ll often get a nicer looking jacket out of it. If you’re planning on giving your closet an overhaul post-pandemic, a vintage leather jacket should be top of your list. Whatever your aesthetic is, you can incorporate this fashion staple into your closet. Before you head out and search for your perfect vintage leather jacket, we have a few styling tips that can help inspire your search. We’re also giving you some practical advice on how to find the perfect vintage jacket for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Pros of Vintage Leather\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe fashion world is changing. More of us than ever are taking an interest in finding more sustainable alternatives for everyday materials. While leather is a durable fabric, it’s not the best choice for the environment. If you’re a vegan, it’s probably something you try to avoid altogether. Buying vintage leather can help solve a common problem most vegans face.\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of faux-leather jackets aren’t made to last, especially if they have a PVC coating. If you want the look of a leather jacket without harming the environment, you can purchase a vintage piece instead. By buying vintage, you save another animal from having to be killed for the leather, while also reducing the amount of clothing going to landfill. While vintage leather isn’t entirely cruelty-free it’s a more sustainable alternative than buying a brand-new leather jacket.\u003cbr\u003eWhile cruelty-free ‘vegan’ leather jackets can be a little harder to come by, they’re still out there. You may need to dig a little more, but with patience and alerts on your favourite re-sale apps, you should be able to track one down that works for you and your style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere To Buy Vintage Leather Jackets\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou’re in luck! It’s never been easier to get your hands on a vintage jacket. Only a few years ago, you’d have to search through dozens of stores to find a vintage jacket that works for you. Thanks to the rise of re-sale platforms like Depop, you can find your dream vintage jacket from the comfort of your own home. You can also shop around and find the best deal to save you a little more in the process.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re buying pre-loved, you want to do your research on popular leather jacket brands and understand what to look for in the leather. Not very leather jacket is perfect, and you might notice imperfections that suggest the jacket isn’t entirely leather. You want to make sure you’re not paying the price of a full leather jacket for a blended material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinding the Perfect Fit\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re shopping online for a vintage leather jacket, it’s a good idea to take your measurements to find the perfect fit. Remember, the perfect fit for a leather jacket is oversized. Put on a chunky sweatshirt and then take your measurements, without holding the tape too close to your body. \u003cbr\u003eA major selling point of the longer calf-length leather jacket is that it makes the perfect addition to your evening wardrobe. You can slip it on over a silk dress for a masculine twist. It’s the jacket you want to pack for your next vacation, when you don’t know if you’re going to end up at a trendy restaurant or sipping cocktails at a casino.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Forget About the Lining\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing that is often overlooked when buying (and styling!) vintage leather jackets is the lining. Most older leather jackets have a cotton lining, instead of polyester. It’s this kind of lining that you want to keep an eye out for as it makes your leather jacket more breathable. If you intend to layer your vintage jacket over jumpers and thicker dresses, you want a thinner lining that won’t make you overheat.\u003cbr\u003eIf things like the lining are important to you, it’s worth grilling the store owner or online seller to see what they know about your jacket. The majority of independent sellers and stores will do their research before putting a leather jacket up for sale, and they’ll happily pass it on to you if it’ll make you more likely to purchase the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a few styles for you to keep an eye out for that are right on-trend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Condition of Your Vintage Leather Jacket\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile leather gets more beautiful with age, not everyone is easy on the material. A leather jacket might have some exciting stories to tell, but it could also be beyond repair. There’s a thin line between ‘aged’ and ‘damaged’. You want to avoid buying a jacket that has a crack in the leather, along some imperfections can be repaired. Most rips or flaws in the lining are easy to solve, or you can have the lining replaced entirely, depending on the fabric originally used.\u003cbr\u003eBefore you commit to buying your vintage jacket, you want to make sure it’s in a wearable condition. If you’re shopping in store, take the time to have an in-depth look at the jacket, including the pockets and zippers. \u003cbr\u003eBefore you set off in search of your leather jacket, you want to consider the type of leather used. If you’re in the market for the real deal, you’ll usually have to choose between full grain or lambskin. While full grain is durable and long-lasting, lambskin is soft to the touch, but more delicate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCalf-Length Vintage Leather Jacket\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to experiment with a long calf-length vintage leather jacket. These are often some of the most versatile silhouettes. You can wear it with anything from dresses to jeans and a t-shirt. If you’re shopping around for one, try and buy one that is a size or more bigger than what you need to give you an oversized look. Your leather jacket should be big enough to comfortably fit a few layers underneath, including a sweater. \u003cbr\u003eYou can style a calf-length leather jacket as a wrap coat, cinching it in at the waist for a more feminine look. All you need is a pair of sneakers or loafers to finish off your look. This silhouette is a favourite amongst streetwear fans and can give you a more elevated look than a casual waist-length leather jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCar Coat\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you prefer a more masculine look, opt for the ‘car coat’ style. This silhouette is similar to a shorter trench coat, but with a leather finish. It’ll hit the same length as your miniskirts, making it a great choice for anyone who lives in shorts or miniskirts. You can wear this style of vintage jacket with everything from your favourite Dr Martens to dad sandals or loungewear.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re shopping for this silhouette, don’t forget to check in the men’s section. This style is genderless and works for any look. The longer length gives you extra versatility and is an alternative to the calf-length if you tend to wear shorter clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe ‘Shirt’ Jacket\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eNot every vintage leather jacket looks like a jacket. One of the most popular styles from the 90s is the classic shirt jacket. It’s a button-up that looks just like your go-to shirts. You can wear it like a jacket over anything from a hoodie to a turtleneck. It’s a piece you can each for when you’re not sure what the day may bring. A shirt jacket is a must0have transitional piece that will see you from the first days of spring, right through to the dead of winter.\u003cbr\u003eThis vintage leather jacket is another genderless option, so you’ll want to make sure to check the menswear section while shopping for this style. For the added versatile, stick to a classic black colour. It’ll go with everything in your closet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to Style Any Vintage Leather Jacket\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA vintage leather jacket can be easier to style than you think. \u003cbr\u003eYou don’t have to have a closet full of pre-loved pieces to be able to wear every day. With the right accessories, you can take your leather jacket from day to night, as a casual or elevated piece.\u003cbr\u003eOne way to add definition to your look is by playing with textures. Add softer pieces, like a cotton shirt or a silk dress, underneath your jacket to make it pop. Denim and leather go hand-in-hand for a casual weekend look. While adding in another texture can help soften your look, you can still wear leather pieces. Dr Martens are the partner in crime for any vintage leather jacket. \u003cbr\u003eLeather is one of the most versatile materials – you can add it to everything from a chiffon dress to a cashmere jumper. It may take some trial and error to find your perfect way of styling your new vintage jacket, but that’s half the fun!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDo you own a vintage leather jacket?

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, let’s make the commitment to wave goodbye to fast fashion. Over the last few years, we’ve all been making changes to our daily lives to help protect the planet and the world around us. One industry that is finally waking up to the role it’s playing with regards to climate change is the fashion industry. It’s an industry built on momentary trends and the need to consume more products at an ever-growing rate. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not just the rate of our consumerism that is the issue, it’s how we make our clothing. Whether it’s the droughts caused by cotton harvesting or the chemicals dumped into water systems in developing countries, the danger of fast fashion is everywhere you look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEvolution of Slow Fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlow fashion is all about saying ‘no’ to ever evolving rends, and instead focusing on expanding the lifespan of our clothing You can think of it as prioritising quality over quantity. Instead of buying a $20 shirt from H\u0026amp;M that you’ll wear once, you can invest in a sustainably made $100 blouse from an eco-friendly brand that you can wear for years to come. Slow fashion is a smart investment, both for your bank balance and the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the evolution of ‘slow fashion’, your clothes can still look current and up to date without you having to jump on every momentary trend. Instead of focusing on pieces that are here one minute and gone the next, slow fashion focuses on staple pieces that define the era, rather than the moment. It takes the approach that clothing is an investment, rather than a folly that you can wear one day and throw away the next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s taken longer than it should have, but the industry is finally turning its attention to the reality of climate change and the need for slow fashion. Embracing slow fashion doesn’t mean you have to turn your back on the industry. It doesn’t mean you have to give up your love of fashion. You can think of it as a reset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that we don’t need to live in a world dominated by trends that disappear in the blink of an eye. It served as an opportunity to refocus our minds and take stock of the situation within the industry. Without the constant runway shows and limited-edition releases, social media turned its attention to raising awareness of the environmental impact of fast fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Impact of the Pandemic\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs the world starts to return to normal, it is slowly resetting itself with a renewed focus on becoming more sustainable. The financial realities of the pandemic meant that designers went from creating four collections (or more) a year, to two. Smaller, independent designers had to turn to batch productions as a way to save their finances and continue to pay their staff as department stores placed smaller orders for stock. \u003cbr\u003eThis batch production radically reduced the waste produced by designers. If a department store ordered 60 dresses, exactly 60 were made. While this may have led to a small delay in you receiving your item, it is minimal compared to the benefits of this slower method of production.\u003cbr\u003eOne thing to note is that slow fashion still brings with it trends. Unlike fast fashion, these trends last for more than one season. These trends are designed to help you get the most out of the garment. Instead of wearing it a handful of times, you’re meant to wear it for at least a few years. \u003cbr\u003eSlow fashion is about looking at the bigger picture, looking beyond just one or two seasons ahead of yourself. It’s defined by elevated basics that are still contemporary, but that you can wear for years without becoming dated.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to create a slow fashion capsule closet, all you need is six pieces to see you through every season. These elevated basics are versatile pieces that you can mix and match with existing pieces in your closet or wear together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAn Elevated Blouse\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou want a blouse that is more elevated than a simple button-up. Instead of a blouse you would wear to work, you want one that you might wear for brunch with your girlfriends at the weekend. It’ll look different for everyone depending on your aesthetic. If you prefer a simpler feminine look, you might want a prairie collar with a puff-sleeve and three-quart length cut. If you’re someone who prefers a vintage-inspired look, you can choose a blouse with a silk finish and a jewel colour scheme. Emerald or ruby red are always glamorous choices. \u003cbr\u003eAn elevated blouse can be worn with anything from leather trousers at the weekend to jeans for a casual look or a pencil skirt to wear to the office. It’s worth having the blouse tailored to give you a more fitted silhouette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eElegant Flat Shoes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eUnless you’re Carrie Bradshaw, you probably don’t need a closet full of shoes. While everyone loves a stiletto, it’s the flat show that is the most practical choice. For years, flat shoes have been outcast as being less fashionable, with trends focusing mainly on higher heels and platforms. If the pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that flat shoes are the most practical thing you can add to your closet. \u003cbr\u003eOver the last year, we’ve all abandoned our high heels for sneakers, Birkenstocks, loafers, and ballet flats. Whatever your aesthetic is, there will be a flat shoe that works for your look. Choose a pair that you know you could dress either up or down, depending on the occasion. \u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to narrowing down your search, you want to choose a durable material like leather and a neutral colour palette, like earth-tones or a classic black shade. These shoes don’t have to come with a designer price tag, but you want to make sure they’re ones that can be easily repaired over time to give you a longer lifespan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA Versatile Cardigan\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eCardigans are one fashion staple that is experiencing a resurgence. While you might think of them as something your grandmother might wear, celebrities like Harry Styles and Taylor Swift have brought them back into vogue once more. Thanks to aesthetics like cottagecore and the rise of vintage fashion, cardigans are once again a wardrobe staple – now with a younger demographic. \u003cbr\u003eThese cardigans look more like something you’d have expected Coco Chanel to wear, and less like the cardigans that make up a school uniform. If you’re adding one to your slow fashion closet, you want to focus on details that elevate your garment. Keep an eye out for elegant detailing on the button (like the interlocking CC on a Chanel button), embellishments, and functional pockets.\u003cbr\u003eDon’t be afraid to pick up a smart cardigan in a pastel or a bold colour, as this can help add something different to your closet and soften your outfits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe All-Day Dress\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDo you know what all the recent dress trends have had in common? They’ve been designed to see you through day to night with ease. Do you remember the midi dress trend that was everywhere before the pandemic hit? Or the shirt dress that everyon4e loved? These are classic examples of the 18-hour dress. It’s a silhouette that can take you from a day at the office to drinks with your friends, all with a quick change of your accessories. \u003cbr\u003eAgain, this is another slow fashion staple that will look different for each person. You want to consider your lifestyle and what works for you. Is it a dress you could see yourself wearing to grab coffee in? Could you wear it to a dinner out with your significant other? While this isn’t a dress that you’ll wear every day, you want to be able to identify situations where you know you could wear it. You also want to choose a length and material that you’ll be comfortable wearing for up to 18-hours in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Tan Handbag\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one handbag colour that will never go out of style, it’s the toffee-tan colour. This colour works for any occasion and is a softer alternative to a classic black handbag. It’s minimalistic and contemporary, while still giving you a glamorous look that has a vintage feel.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re shopping around for your slow-fashion handbag, take the time to look for brands that use sustainable materials. Everything from plastic bottles to waste leather is being used to make handbags. If you’re a fan of vegan fashion, you can even choose cork as the material for your bag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSweatpants\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThese are another post-pandemic addition. If there’s one piece of clothing that we’re all living in, it’s our sweatpants and loungewear. These pieces were already making a name for themselves thanks to the athleisure trend, but they’ve become an essential during the pandemic. A pair of minimalistic sweatpants can be styled with anything from an oversized sweater to a blazer and aviator sunglasses. \u003cbr\u003eFor your slow fashion closet, you want a style that is tailored but still comfortable, with a streamlined look and a fabric that can withstand a few years of wear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think of slow fashion?

Over the last few years, we’ve all been making changes to our daily lives to help protect the planet and the world around us. One industry that is finally waking up to the role it’s playing with regards to climate change is the fashion industry. It’s an industry built on momentary trends and the need to consume more products at an ever-growing rate. It’s not just the rate of our consumerism that is the issue, it’s how we make our clothing. Whether it’s the droughts caused by cotton harvesting or the chemicals dumped into water systems in developing countries, the danger of fast fashion is everywhere you look. ",

You can wave goodbye to your ankle boots and pre-pandemic heels. This summer is all about sandals. With the popularity of athleisure and activewear, its no surprise that sandals have become the ‘it’ shoe of the season for 2021. They’re the perfect alternative to sneakers if you want to shake up your summer closet. These shoes are the easiest to style during the summer and deserve a spot at the front of your closet.\u003cbr\u003eWith sandals, you can go from a day at the beach to cocktails with your friends at a downtown bar. As we say hello to the new ‘normal’ and life starts to resume after the pandemic, your sandals are the perfect choice of footwear to see you through your coffee catchups and socially distanced walks. As the ‘it’ shoe for summer 2021, you’re spoilt for choice with every designer and brand bringing out their version of these classic shoes. \u003cbr\u003eWe’re rounding up six of our favourite sandals for summer 2021. If you see these styles in stock, it’s an instant ‘add to cart’. We’re also sharing some of our favourite styling tips, so you can get an idea of how to incorporate these shoes into your summer closet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChanel Dad Sandals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen Chanel came out with their now infamous ‘Dad’ sandals, the fashion world raised an eyebrow. Like anything with the Chanel logo, it’s quickly become a classic. These sandals are almost impossible to come across in store. If you’re thinking of making a splurge purchase for the comfiest – and quirkiest – designer sandals, these Chanel shoes will be right up your street.\u003cbr\u003eIf you pick up a pair with the ‘Chanel’ name across the front strap, they’ll add a little streetwear twist to any summer outfit. Chanel recently came out with a nautical themed rope-inspired espadrille version, which gives the shoes an extra dose of summer charm. We’ll be wearing them with our favourite smock dresses and dressing them up with a short and blazer combo for drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFisherman’s Sandals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you want comfort without compromising on style, fisherman’s sandals are your summer BFF. These shoes are a staple for brands like Church’s. If you’re looking to invest (and want extra comfort!) try to pick this style up in leather. The leather will naturally mould to your feet and help you stay walking for hours during the summer. If you want to save your pennies, you can find this style from popular high street brands like Zara and H\u0026amp;M. They’re the grown-up version of the jelly sandals that every 90s kid had.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSolid Flip Flops\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOkay, here us out. While these shoes are often thought of as what you wear after a manicure to keep your polish smudge-free, they’re full of 2000s nostalgia. Whether you’re jumping on the Y2K trend or not, these shoes are a style you want to have in your closet. They’re easy to throw into your backpack to take with you on the go. If you’re hitting the beach this summer, you’ll want at least one pair in your beach bag. \u003cbr\u003eWhat makes fit flops a better choice is that they have a higher sole and are less likely to break on you. You can give your outfit a touch of 2000s nostalgia without worrying about breaking the tongue of the shoe. \u003cbr\u003eWhile the chunky flip flop trend was resurrected by The Row, you can find this style almost anywhere. For a classic look, try to stick to black as your colour of choice. Don’t forget to book yourself in for a pedicure before slipping your feet into a pair of these flip flops. Once the temperatures skyrocket, you’ll be glad that you have these shoes in your closet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBirkenstock \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlmost all the summer 2021 sandal trends are casual ‘dad’ shoes. The OG style – the classic Birkenstock – is still going strong for this summer. If you didn’t pick up a pair at the start of the pandemic, now is your time! These shoes will never be off your feet during the summer. You can wear them with anything from loungewear while grabbing your morning coffee to an elevated party outfit with a high-slit skirt and blouse. \u003cbr\u003eThese shoes are a must-have for anyone who is creating a capsule summer closet. They’re top of our packing list for any summer vacation. Black is a sandal colour that can do no wrong, but don’t be afraid to think outside the box. The popularity of the Birkenstock style means you can pick one up in almost every colour. The OG Birkenstock is a similar style to the Chanel ‘dad’ sandals, with the key difference being their open back.\u003cbr\u003eIf you don’t want to splurge on a pair of Chanel sandals, the Birkenstock is just as iconic and timeless. This shoe has earnt its place on the ‘must have sandals’ list for the rest of eternity. Birkenstocks come in a few different materials, whether you like a leather sole or an eco-friendlier alternative. You can even pick up a pair with suede lining if you want extra comfort. If you don’t want to invest in Birkenstocks, you can find dupes for these shoes in almost every clothing store.\u003cbr\u003eTrust us. Birkenstocks are one of the most versatile shoes you can add to your closet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSparkly Sandals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe sandals on our must-have list for summer 2021 have all been fairly casual so far. With the world reopening again, it’s time to add a little sparkle into your life. If you plan on hitting the night clubs or have a special occasion coming up, sparkly sandals are the perfect summer choice. If there’s one brand that dominates the luxury sandal scene, it’s Amina Muaddi. The designer’s popularity has skyrocketed thanks to collaborations with Rihanna’s Fenty brand.\u003cbr\u003eIf you happen to strike gold and find a pair of Amina Muaddi summer sandals, pull out your credit card and run them to the check out. These shoes have been an instant sell-out, with influencers and celebrities alike being photographed in the sparkly gladiator-inspired summer sandals. \u003cbr\u003eThe sparkly straps will show off your fresh summer tan – as well as your manicure – while elongating your legs. You can wear to a summer wedding with a midi dress or revisit your favourite restaurant in a little black dress. Let these stunning shoes take centre stage with your outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMule Slides\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAfter jumping on the fashion scene in 2016, the slides have gone from a gym staple to a fashion classic. Gucci was one of the first designer brands to bring the simple slide into the mainstream. The Italian fashion house has given their slides an upgrade for summer 2021 by creating a mule slide. The mules are another staple in the Gucci catalogue, so it’s no surprise that the brand has brought two of their bestselling styles together.\u003cbr\u003eWhat we love about these shoes is their minimalism. You can pick them up in every colour of the rainbow, from simple white to periwinkle blue or barbie pink. Another bonus? These are some of the most affordable (or attainable!) shoes from the Gucci brand. As they’re made using rubber, these shoes are around half the price of a pair of Gucci sneakers or flats. If you want to buy your first pair of designer summer shoes, these are the perfect choice. \u003cbr\u003eThe subtle Gucci logo makes them easy to style. We’ll be wearing them along the seafront with an oversized shirt dress and our favourite aviator sunglasses. These are another pair of shoes that you’ll want to invest in a pedicure for. \u003cbr\u003eWe’re expecting to see these shoes everywhere this summer – on both celebrities and influencers alike. They’re already all over Instagram, so we expect them to become the must-have shoe for summer 2021. Run, don’t walk, to grab these shoes before they sell out.\u003cbr\u003eWhat to Consider When Buying Summer Sandals\u003cbr\u003eSummer sandals take a little more thought than your average everyday shoes. Our feet go through a lot during the summer. If you’re planning on wearing your sandals all day, you want a style that will absorb sweat and moisture to prevent odour gathering in your shoes. No one likes the smell of feet.\u003cbr\u003eIf you can, it’s usually best to buy sandals in person as the size can vary. You might find that you have to go down half a size for a comfortable fit. If you’re buying sandals online, take a few extra seconds to double-check the recommended sizing before you checkout. \u003cbr\u003eThe material can make or break the wearability of your summer sandals. While the rubber Gucci slides are iconic, you won’t want to be caught in an unexpected rainstorm in them. If you’re not sure what the weather is going to bring, leather sandals are a tried-and-tested style that will see you through anything.\u003cbr\u003eWhich sandals are you buying this summer? Do you have a favourite style or are you re-wearing a classic from your closet? Let us know in the comments below!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eWhether it’s the clothes we wear or the transport we use to go to work, we’re all trying to make more conscious choices in our everyday lives. The fashion industry is one of the biggest production sectors in the world – and also one of the most damaging. Rising consumerism and ever-changing trends have brought with it the concept of fast fashion. The keep up with demand, brands are turning to cheaper production methods, which are often damaging to the people making your clothes and the planet at large. \u003cbr\u003eDo you ever stop to think of where your clothes have come from? The fact you’ve clicked on this article suggest you probably have. With the lack of transparency within the industry, it’s easy to feel like making ethical and conscious fashion choices is virtually impossible. We’re here to prove otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you know why ethical and conscious fashion is important, you’ll never be able to shop the same way again. It doesn’t take the enjoyment out of fashion – if anything, it makes you feel better about the clothing you buy. You can enjoy your clothes without worrying about the working conditions of the people who made it and the environmental damage of the dyes and textiles used.\u003cbr\u003eOur guide covers everything you need to know about ethical and conscious fashion – often called ‘slow fashion’ and the changes you can make to your clothes shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Fast Fashion?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFast fashion is the term used to describe the current situation in the fashion industry. We’re making clothes faster than ever before and going through them in half the price we once did. Only a few years ago, brands released one collection a season. Now, stores like Zara are releasing up to 20+ collections a year. Social media is partly to blame. With a new trend coming from TikTok and Instagram every week, we all feel the need to be constantly buying new clothes. \u003cbr\u003eThanks to the internet, it’s never been easier to buy cheap clothing from anywhere in the world. To meet this rising demand for cheaper and faster clothing, brands are responding by focusing on increasing efficiency by cutting corners, using cheaper materials, and largely ignoring the environmental impact of the fashion industry. \u003cbr\u003eThe internet is full of stats and information about the dangers of fast fashion. Here’s a few headlines that you should know, so you can understand why it’s important to make conscious fashion choices:\u003cbr\u003e•\t10% of the world’s carbon emission comes from the fashion industry, creating around 1.2 billion tons of CO2 emissions. If the current growth level continues, this will hit 26% in the next 30 years.\u003cbr\u003e•\tIf we choose more sustainable options and double the lifespan of our clothes, we can reduce emissions by 24%.\u003cbr\u003e•\tIt takes 700 gallons of water to make one cotton t-shirt, about the amount the water an adult drinks every three and a half years.\u003cbr\u003e•\tThree-fifths of clothing ends up in landfill within a year of us purchasing it. Greenpeace estimate that 20% of the clothing in our closet are never worn once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy We Need Ethical Fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWe often forget to think about the people behind our clothing. Not the designers or the brand ambassadors – but rather the people making our clothing and the communities they live in. \u003cbr\u003eWhile most of the design and marketing for brands happens in United States or Europe, their clothing production occurs in developing countries. The numbers of people working in the textile industry is growing every year to meet the demands of fast fashion. In 2000, there were 20 million workers in the garment production industry. This number had jumped to around 85 million by 2014. Manufacturing – including fashion production - is the second largest industry for modern slavery, coming behind only the agriculture industry.\u003cbr\u003eNot only do these workers have to deal with poor working conditions, but they also often make significantly less than the living wage. What perhaps impacts them most is the damage that fast fashion causes their local communities.\u003cbr\u003eIn India, 100 million people do not have access to clean drinking water while 85% of the water needed for the population is used for cotton production. The environmental impact of these dyes and chemicals is most prominent in China, where 80% of groundwater from the major river basins are considered to be “unsuitable” for human contact. \u003cbr\u003eMaking conscious fashion choices also includes making ethical ones. You want to find brands that promote the fact they pay their workers a fair living wage, including their textile workers and farmers. Unfortunately, there’s no real equivalent to a ‘free trade’ symbol in the fashion industry, but a little research should usually tell you everything you need to know about a brand and its ethical credentials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow To Become a More Sustainable Fashion Follower\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eEvery day, we are becoming more aware of the dangers of fast fashion. Millennials and Gen Z are leading the way with sustainable fashion. Whether it’s shopping second hand or looking for environmentally friendly materials, we’re all taking steps to become more sustainable with our fashion choices. \u003cbr\u003eMaking ethical and sustainable fashion choices is easier than you think. Not sure where to start? A good way is to start looking into the pre-loved market and thrift stores. Everything comes back in style again, and you can find vintage clothing that looks right on trend. Shopping second-hand means you can save a pretty penny, still be on trend, and save clothing from landfill.\u003cbr\u003eThrifting and buying clothing second-hand are becoming even more popular, especially with vintage trends dominating the industry. A quick scroll through Instagram or TikTok will show you the popularity of sites like Depop and Vestiaire Collective.\u003cbr\u003eMost of us are buying more clothing than ever before, with the life span of our clothes splitting in half since 2000. Making more conscious fashion choices includes responsibly getting rid of clothing that you no longer wear. \u003cbr\u003eIt’s also a good idea to learn some basic sewing skills. Instead of throwing out a shirt when a button comes undone, you can sew it back on again and get right back to wearing it. Being able to repair clothing is an essential life skill and can help you give your clothes a second life. Keeping your clothes in a wearable condition can also make it easier to sell or donate them when the time comes to find them a new home.\u003cbr\u003eAnother way you can make conscious fashion choices is by becoming a more informed consumer and make purposeful purchases. Instead of buying something on an impulse, force yourself to stop and ask, ‘do I really need it?’. If you can’t picture at least five occasions when you’d wear the outfit, it probably isn’t for you. For anyone looking to cut down on their fashion consumption, you can look into build a capsule closet. Most people with capsule closets take a ‘one in, one out’ approach with their clothes. If you want something new, you have to free up space by selling or donating something you already have.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re making conscious fashion choices, the golden rule of thumb is ‘quality over quantity’. Instead of buying five $20 shirts, you want to invest that money into one $100 shirt that you know will stand the test of time. When you’re buying less clothing, you can afford to put that money into higher quality pieces that you can wear for years.\u003cbr\u003eOne way you can become a more ethical and conscious fashion fan is to stop following trends. Yep, you heard us right. It’s easy to get pulled into thinking you have to be on top of all the latest trends – that you really need that polka dot dress from Zara that is all over your Instagram feed. You can make more conscious fashion choices by becoming more comfortable in your own aesthetic. Thanks to influencer culture, we’re surrounded by cleverly disguised advertisements every time we open our phone. \u003cbr\u003eInstead of being influenced by other people, focus on buying clothing that matches your personal style and what makes you happy. If a garment makes you feel and look amazing, you’re more likely to keep wearing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat You Can Do to Promote Slow Fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eConsumers and brands are coming together to forge a sustainable future. Thanks to social media, you can now speak directly to your favourite brands. Do you want to keep buying from a store, but you’re not sure about their environmental initiatives? You can drop them a DM on Instagram and ask about their policies. You never know, you might inspire them to adopt a sustainability plan and adopt slow fashion.\u003cbr\u003eThe best way to show support for slow fashion is to vote with your feet (and wallet!). When the fashion industry sees that there’s a growing demand for sustainable clothing, they’re more likely to respond by giving you what you want.\u003cbr\u003eThe next time a friend or family member suggest a shopping spree, you can take the time to explain to them why you’re making more conscious fashion choices. The best way you can promote slow fashion is by raising awareness for it within your local community. \u003cbr\u003eHow are you making more ethical and conscious fashion choices?

The shade is universally flattering and gives your skin a healthy flush, while warming up your complexion. When we think about pink makeup, the first products that usually come to mind are lipsticks and blushes. The world of pink makeup goes beyond this – there are highlighters, eyeshadows, and even eyeliners to choose from.\u003cbr\u003eWhether you’re saying ‘I do’ or grabbing brunch with your girlfriends, pink makeup is always a good idea! Just like rose gold has a moment a few years ago, pink makeup is having the same. Just like pink hair and pastel clothes are all the rage, pink makeup has jumped onto the scene as the must-try trend for 2021.\u003cbr\u003ePink is a colour you can wear almost anywhere on your face. You can swipe it along your cheeks, tap it on your eyelids, or add a coat of it along your lips. It gives your look a romantic feel and creates a soft aesthetic. You can wear the same shade of pink or add depth to your look by using different hues of pink. \u003cbr\u003eYou have 50 shades of pink to choose from – ranging from bubblegum pink to baby pink, dark magenta, and peach pink. Pink is a neutral colour, if you know how to use it. It’s one of the few colours that works for every skin tone and complexion. Whether you’re a minimalist or a maximalist, you can use different shades of pink to create a myriad of look.\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of experimenting with pink is that it’s one colour that every brand carries It’s not like green or blue, where you’ll struggle to find blush or lipstick to work. Pink is a universal colour that appears in every makeup product range – and almost every makeup palette includes a few pink shades. \u003cbr\u003ePink is an unapologetically feminine shade and one that every woman has in her makeup bag. You can use it to add a touch of romanticism to your look or to channel your inner supermodel. Everyone from Rihanna to Kylie Jenner and Cardi B have been photographed working pink \u0026nbsp;makeup looks.\u003cbr\u003eWith summer just around the corner, it’s the perfect time to start experimenting with the colour. As there’s so many tones and hues to choose from, you can wear pink all year round. We’re sharing some of the must-try pink makeup trends for 2021 that flatter every skin tone, along with the best way to apply these products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePink Eyeshadow\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf there’s one makeup trend that every celebrity is wearing right now, it’s pink eyeshadows. One of the first celebrities to wear the colour on the red carpet was Lady Gaga, who used a petal-pink eyeshadow with rhinestones for a glamorous look. \u003cbr\u003eWith the right application and shade choice, pink eyeshadow can be more versatile that you first expect. You can use it to create everything from soft natural looks to romantic glamorous evening looks.\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes pink so versatility is the sheer variety of shades available for you to choose from. You can use three or four shades to create a pastel smoky eye. You want to start with a lighter champagne pink on the inner corner to make your eyes pop. After that, you can blend out the shadows, developing to a darker pink as you reach the outer crease. With a darker pink eyeshadow look, you can keep the attention on your eyes by adding a lighter ‘your lips but better’ shade of pink.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to be subtle with your pink eyeshadow. Sometimes, more is better. You can take a leaf from Lady Gaga’s book and add rhinestones to your eyeshadow to make it more dramatic. If you’re someone who prefers a little shimmer, you can take your pink makeup look to the next level. Pink can have high impact if you know how to blend the colours. A glittery fuchsia shadow can be blended from your eyelids to the crease, adding in a lighter hue to create depth for the look. You’ll want to take your lightest shade of pink and apply it to the inner corner of your eyes to brighten your look.\u003cbr\u003eEyeshadow no longer has to sit just on your eyelids. You can spread it out from the corner of your lids to your temples for a romantic look. The key to this look is to keep the rest of your makeup as simple as possible, focusing on adding length to your lashes and a glow to your checks. If you want to carry the pink through to your lips, you’ll want to choose a shade that’s darker than your eyeshadow choice to balance out your look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMonochrome\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you fall in love with a shade of pink – why not use it all over? This method works best if you can find a multitasking 3-in-1 product. It works best if you have a shade you can apply to your lips, cheeks, and eyes. Stay on the lookout for liquid tints that are safe for your eyes. If you can’t find an all-in-one product, try and find the closet match of shades that look like they’re in the same hue of pink. \u003cbr\u003eFor a monochrome look to work and not appear too flat, you want to choose a buildable colour. Keep it as sheer as possible on your cheeks, before building it up at your lips, and then going darker across your eyelids. With a monochrome look, it’s easier to start with one aspect of your look – whether it’s your eyes or lips – and build the rest of your look around it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSubtle Touch of Pink\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re starting to experiment with a new makeup trend, you might want to keep it simple at the beginning. Instead of jumping off at the deep end, you can go more minimalistic. Take a leaf from Kylie Jenner’s book and keep your pink eyeshadow to the inner corners of your eyes. This look makes a statement without being too overpowering. You can blend the pink out to a lighter neutral or champagne colour. You’ll want to make sure to smudge out the pink eyeshadow to avoid it looking too harsh. This look can get you used to wear the colour pink, so that you can slowly upgrade to a full makeup or eyeshadow look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePeachy Glow\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBeauty trends are all revolving around the idea of creating an inner glow by brightening your complexion. We often think of clear lip gloss and ‘barely there’ makeup as a way of achieving this, but pink colours are just as glowing. We love this look by Rihanna, who took a cool-tone pink shade and blended it from your eye lid into the crease, before adding a light touch of mascara. \u003cbr\u003eInstead of using your average champagne or golden highlighter, you can swap it out for a peachy pink glow. You want to apply your highlighter to the area of your face where the sun naturally hits, including the tip of your nose, cupid’s bow, cheekbones, and your brow bone. \u003cbr\u003eYou can finish off your look with a crystal pink lip gloss with a subtle shimmer that gives you a glassy look. If your lips are naturally darker, you can apply foundation first to neutralise the colour, before filling your lips in with a liner and lipstick. \u003cbr\u003eStarting with a peachy glow look is the perfect way to get used to wearing pink shades instead of your normal neutrals. You can add a glow to your eyeshadow look buy creating an ombre gradient effect that goes from a pale pink, almost white, before darkening in the outer corners. If you feel like making a statement and adding another layer of glitter, why not try a monotone cut crease?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMatch Your Look to Your Hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re lucky enough to be rocking the pink hair trend, you can match your hair colour to your makeup. It’s a look that Cardi B nailed when heading to the red carpet. With pink hair becoming more common, you can easily adopt it as your new hair colour. The goal with this trend is to choose a colour for your eyeshadow and lipstick that compliment your hair shade. \u003cbr\u003eThere are no firm rules with this look, but it’s a good idea to try and keep everything in the same colour family. You can add slightly darker and lighter hues to your makeup. If pink is your favourite colour, you can even carry it through to your nails. While this may feel a little extreme, you can carry it off if you choose complimenting shades that work with your skin tone. The more coats of pink that you add to your look, the more shades you want to experiment with. Having too much on the same pink tone can make your look appear flat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich of these pink makeup looks are you going to try?

You might be a size 14 in one store, and a size 18 in the other. Even within the same brand, you could be two completely different sizes in similar garments. You want to ignore what the label says and instead focus on how the clothes look on you when deciding which size to buy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eA common mistake people make is thinking they have to buy their ‘true size’, which could end up causing visible panty lines or cut into your side.

Sometimes wearing a size bigger can give you a more comfortable – and flattering – fit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing we should touch on is colour palettes. People tend to think that they have to wear black clothes to hide their curves away. No colour – or print – is off-limits to you. You can wear a pastel pink or a polka dot pattern, whatever makes you feel good. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere are things you can do to make certain trends or clothing more wearable. If you’re a fan of dresses, but struggle with chafing, you can slip on a pair of bicycle shorts underneath your dress. This can avoid any kind of chafing and make it easier for you to wear your dresses all day long. If your dress isn’t long enough to disguise shorts, you can add an anti-chafing cream to have the same effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that you have an idea of what to keep in mind, we’re rounding up all of our top outfit ideas for plus size women in 2022.

Like we said – ignore the label.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003ePlus size women sometimes find that men’s shirt fit them best as it allows for extra room around the chest area for a more relaxed fit, and to reduce tension on the buttons. If you’re going with an oversized print, balance it out with a more understated neutral colour for the rest of you outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eJumpsuits \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eJumpsuits are a staple in the plus size fashion world as an alternative to dresses.

A jumpsuit can be worn with everything from signature white sneakers to wedge espadrilles or stiletto heels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFloral Dress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of our favourite plus size outfits is floral dresses. This style can see you through more than just spring and summer. Say no to the idea of only wearing black and shake up your look with a floral dress instead.

Floral dresses are a sign that you don’t care what anyone says you can or can’t wear as a plus size woman. If you love feminine fashion, you want to have at least one floral dress that you can reach for throughout the year when you need a go-to piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Shy from Silk Fabrics\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother common misconception is that plus size woman can’t wear silk dresses. We beg to differ. The beauty of a plus size woman’s curves means a silk dress can take on a new shape. It’ll accentuate your curves and be comfortable enough to wear all day long. If you’re looking for a dress you can wear on a night-out or on a date with your partner, a silk dress will give you a sultry look. One of the benefits of silk is that it’s a luxurious fabric that keeps you comfortable without compromising on style. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile black is a classic colour, why not experiment with red instead?

After all, clothes are made with an arbitrary size in mind, not accounting for the nuances of different body types. You might find a dress that you love, with a print that speaks to your personality. It’s all going well until you realize that the dress doesn’t have much shape to it. This problem is a common one for plus-size women – but there’s an easy solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eInvest in a thin belt that fits your waist. You can use it on anything from blazer dresses to maxi dresses or even a ribbed shirt dress. Adding a belt will give your dress a more defined silhouette, while showing off your curves. If you want to splurge on an accessory, a belt is a great idea. Unlike clothes that might not fit you somewhere down the road, a belt can always be adjusted to fit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe LBD\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we said you shouldn’t have to wear black, it can still do amazing things for your curves – if you know how to wear it. For a minimalistic aesthetic, keep your look clean and classic. Find a timeless silhouette and give it a contemporary twist. You could look for a little black dress that has a one-shoulder cut or a back cut-out. Updating a classic like a little black dress and making it your own can give you a major confidence boost. An LBD will never go out of style, and your dress size doesn’t determine whether you can or can’t wear one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAdd a Neon Pop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of colour palettes, don’t be afraid to add a neon pop to your look – and in unexpected ways as well. You can keep it subtle with a bubblegum pink handbag or think outside the box with a pair of neon tights. The best way to wear neon is to balance them out with a predominantly neutral-tone outfit. You can make your neon pieces pop by wearing a white dress or your go-to jeans and t-shirt combo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat advice do you have for buying plus size fashion?

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eGrab your makeup bag – there’s a new TikTok trend and we’re already all over it. The resurgence of the 60s mod eye makeup look is proof that makeup trends always come back in vogue – even if it takes a few decades. When the trend comes back around again, we’re all wondering “why did we ever let this trend die?”. The mod eye makeup is the latest trend to come back with the bag. Like most of today’s trends, you can thank TikTok for fuelling its comeback moment. The ‘60s mod makeup is all about using pastel shades, dark creases, and over-the-top lash lines that were beloved by stars of the era, like Cher and Twiggy. If you take a scroll through TikTok, you’ll see almost every twenty-something girl rocking this eye makeup look. \u003cbr\u003eThere’s no hard or fast way of doing the ‘60s mod eye makeup look. Like everything, it’s open to interpretation and everyone has their preferences for how they like to do their makeup routine. We’re no exception to that rule. Trying to wrap your head around a new (or old but new!) trend can be confusing, especially one that looks distinctively different from what we consider to be everyday makeup. To help you along the way, we’re sharing our step-by-step process for how we recreate this iconic 1960s makeup look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re sharing all our tips and tricks – including how to make the most of your eyelid space and the best way to keep your hands steady to perfect your eyeliner look. Within no time, you’ll have perfected the 60s mod eye makeup look. Warning: you’ll want to post your makeup all over your Instagram page, so make sure to have your ring-light at the ready.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGrab Your Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we jump into how to do this makeup look, you need to make sure you have all the tools you need to put together the look. One makeup tool you 100% need is a black pencil or gel eyeliner – whichever you find easiest to work with. You want to choose a formula that is long-lasting and won’t dry out right away, as you’ll want to play around with your eyeliner while creating the minimalistic shapes on your eyelid.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s best to start experimenting with black eyeliner, but once you’re more comfortable with the application method, you can change up the look and incorporate other colours. You can stay true to the aesthetic of the 1960s and add a pop of pastel to your makeup look or think outside the box with a white pencil or gel eyeliner instead.\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has their own go-to eyeliner pencil or gel. If you want a more streamlined look, keep an eye out for a gel liner that gives you a very fine line, with a feather-like brush that allows you to work with tiny strokes. For beginners to the world of makeup – or those trying this trend for the first time – a pencil liner is usually the easiest one to work with as it gives you the most control with the least risk of smudging.\u003cbr\u003eAlong with your liner for your eyelid, you’ll need a black liquid eyeliner for your bottom lashes and to help define the base shape of your eyelid. If you’re someone who fears they might smudge their makeup, it’s usually a good idea to pick up a waterproof eyeliner to improve its longevity. \u003cbr\u003eWith any eye makeup look, your lashes are an essential step you can’t over look. If you want to stay true to the 1960s aesthetic, you need to create voluminous fluff lashes. Falsies are usually the easiest way of getting this look, but they’re not for everyone. If you’re using a mascara, focus on finding one that has a voluminous forward that prioritises that over length or colour.\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to go with falsie eyelashes, it’s usually a good idea to keep an eye out for fan lashes that are evenly spread out with the same density across the lash band.\u003cbr\u003eAs it’s your first time experimenting with this eye makeup, it’s a good idea to keep some essentials on hand. You’re more likely than not going to make at least a few mistakes – and that’s good. Practice makes perfect. Keep a bottle of micellar water and some cotton rounds near by to quickly remove your eye makeup if you make a mistake or smudge it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFirst Step – Small Eyeliner Wing\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA common misconception is that your first step is to go in and do the dramatic cut crease first. As this is the hardest step to do, you deliberately want to leave it to last. You can ease yourself into the look (especially as a beginner!) by doing your standard cat-eye eyeliner wig. You can use your liquid eyeliner for this step.\u003cbr\u003eNot sure how to do a basic eyeliner wing? Create a thin black liner that goes from the groove of your lash line, keeping it as thin as possible by applying only the lightest of pressure to the eyeliner. Bring the line out juts a little to create a wing, while drawing it inwards before stopping at the inner corner of your eye. For this 60s looks, the tail of your eyeliner wing should be drawn down instead of its usual upward silhouette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTake a Stencil and Figure Out Your Crease\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want to use a stencil to map out the area that is considered your crease for this look. In fact, you’ll be working just above your natural crease. Doing this step gives you the illusion of larger and wider eyes. While not everyone has to do it this way, it’s a game changer if you have hooded eyelids or a smaller eyelid surface to work with.\u003cbr\u003eYou can create a stencil for your makeup look by keeping your eyes fixed on a mirror. With your eyes ahead of you, take your liquid eyelid and add a dot towards the end of the crease, just above where the crease sits. You want to add another one to the centre of your eye – again, above the crease. A third one should be at the start or inner section of your crease. These three dots are your stencils and allow the person to use their gel or pencil eyeliner to connect the dots.\u003cbr\u003eIf you have smaller eyelids and are struggling to do this step, you can look down into a mirror, holding at chin level. This method is a must-try for beginners as it means you don’t have to worry about blinking and messing up your eyeliner look by drawing an uneven line. It also makes it easier for you to identify where your crease is, so you can draw the line above your eyelid.\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone with a smaller eyelid, we have another tip you can use. You can create the illusion that you have larger eyelid space than you actually do by drawing a thicker line along your crease with a darker eyeliner. A thicker crease line is more visible when you open your eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Forget Your Lashes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike any makeup look, your eyelashes will make or break how it makes you look or feel. Whatever you do, you want to avoid accidentally leaving your home without wearing any mascara or falsies. It’s a major fashion paus pax. You can apply false eyelashes for a 60s mode eye makeup look the same way you would apply them for an everyday makeup look.\u003cbr\u003eMake sure to trim your falsies to the correct length for your eyes, before applying a line layer of lash adhesive to the band. You want to wait thirty seconds for the glue to become tacky before placing it along your lash line. The best application focuses on placing the lashes on top of your natural lashes – to help them blend together – without physically putting your lashes on top of each other.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to make your eyes appear a little fuller, you can add a neutral-tone colour to your eyelids below the crease. Another tip is to add a nude-coloured eyeliner to the waterline of your eyes to make them appear bigger.\u003cbr\u003eWhen you’re adding your exaggerated lashes to your lower lash line, you want to go in first with a pencil liner. For anyone struggling to make their lashes look fuller and longer, you can apply a few coats of mascara before you start with the rest of this tutorial. You can go over your lash line with a small fan brush to place down some pigments for a more even look.\u003cbr\u003eYour bottom lashes are a guide to help you work out the section between each hair component. Do your line with a pencil first, before going back over it with an eyeliner. You can use a little help to make sure that the lines are as crisp as possible by following-up with a cotton bud and micellar water to clean up any mistakes or errors.\u003cbr\u003eWe hope this makeup tutorial has shown you all the main steps for creating a 60s mod eye look. Don’t forget to make sure you’re using the right products, and that you have some makeup remover on hand to fix any mistakes. Don’t forget – makeup is a form of artwork and it’s an expression of who you are. If you make a mistake, all you have to do is wipe it away with your makeup remove.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think of the ‘60s mod eye trend?

The resurgence of the 60s mod eye makeup look is proof that makeup trends always come back in vogue – even if it takes a few decades. When the trend comes back around again, we’re all wondering “why did we ever let this trend die?”. The mod eye makeup is the latest trend to come back with the bag. Like most of today’s trends, you can thank TikTok for fuelling its comeback moment. The ‘60s mod makeup is all about using pastel shades, dark creases, and over-the-top lash lines that were beloved by stars of the era, like Cher and Twiggy. If you take a scroll through TikTok, you’ll see almost every twenty-something girl rocking this eye makeup look. ",

Your foundation needs to withstand having fabric pressed against it for hours a day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour foundation takes the role of evening your skin tone, diminishing the appearance of imperfections, while adding a radiant glow to your skin. You need your foundation to work in every situation – whether it’s a Zoom call with your colleagues or a day out wearing your face mask. Your foundation should look as good in real life as it does on Zoom – and just as good under your mask as it does above it.

Sometimes, less is more. Start out with a thin layer of foundation and build up the coverage to get your desired look. Another way to stop yourself from being too heavy handed with your foundation is to apply it to the back of your hand first, before using a beauty blender or sponge to apply it from the back of your hand to your face. This method makes it easier for you to control how much foundation you’re putting on your skin. A lightweight foundation makes it easier to layer the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWork from The Centre of Your Face\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of starting with your forehead or cheeks, you want to focus your application on the centre of your face. Use a beauty blender to pat your foundation onto the sides of your nose, before moving outwards to the top of your cheeks and under your eyes. The majority of your foundation should sit on the centre of your skin, which is then blended outwards. Once you’ve taken the foundation to your cheeks, you want to simply blend out what’s left on your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAvoid putting foundation on the tip of your nose – instead, focus on applying it to the side of your nose. Keeping the front of your nose makeup free gives the illusion that you’re not wearing any foundation in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis tip is essential during the pandemic, as your mask will sit on top of your nose, meaning it can lift the foundation from the bridge. The rigid frame on most masks cling to the contours of your face, limiting the airflow to your skin. Whatever foundation you have on your nose is likely going to smudge. \u003cbr\u003eBefore you put your face mask on, it’s a good idea to take a sponge and remove any excess foundation from the bridge of your nose and blend it to the side of your nose and cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTry Applying with Your Fingers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a common misconception that you shouldn’t apply your foundation with your fingertips and that a beauty sponge or brush is a must-have for your\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/tag/make-up\"\u003e makeup routine. \u003c/a\u003eUsing your fingertips allows you to warm up the foundation, which will make you skin look and feel better. When you use your fingertips, you have more control over the amount of foundation hat you use. You’ll naturally use less foundation with this method than if you use a brush or sponge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe easiest method for applying foundation with your fingertips is to pat it onto your skin using either your middle or ring finger, blending it outwards with the same finger until it blends in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re not a fan of using your fingertips – especially if you’re wearing acrylics – you can use a makeup brush instead. If you insist on using a makeup brush, it’s best to choose one that has softer bristles, as this will make it easier for you to blend the colour. You can avoid streaks in your foundation by using the brush to blend it upwards in the direction of your hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKnow How to Correctly Use a Sponge\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most popular way to apply your foundation right now is to use a sponge. If you choose this method, you want to make sure you do it properly. The main issue with using a sponge is that it can absorb too much of your foundation, wasting some of your product. Before you add the foundation to your sponge, dampen it with a water spray to avoid this. You want to use the side of the sponge or whichever side of it has the largest surface area. Start by patting it onto your skin in a bouncing motion before blending. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re using a beauty blender, take the pointed end to evenly blend the foundation under your eyes and in the creases of your nose.

With more of us heading back to the office, this isn’t a luxury most of us can enjoy.

Thicker products will melt under the heat of your mask and can smear across your face or leave marks on the inside of your mask. Instead, swap your foundation out for a concealer and target it only on the areas of your skin where you have imperfections. You can set your concealer with a touch of translucent powder to prevent is smudging under your mask. If you’re heading out for the day or want to add a little colour to the lower half of your face, you can swap your foundation out for a tinted moisturizer.

Online shopping or eCommerce doesn’t provide the necessary peace of mind to some shoppers. \u003cbr\u003eHow do we address this gap?\u003cbr\u003eBy providing the users a platform where they can ask questions about the product and see it in action, live. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, only livestream shopping offers exactly that. This is why it has been a growing trend in the retail shopping world. \u003cbr\u003eChina is leading the livestream shopping industry. The rest of the world is also realizing the importance of providing users with a better consumer experience through livestreaming. \u003cbr\u003eAmazon, Google, Instagram, and Facebook have jumped on the bandwagon and launched their own online shopping platforms as well. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of this article, you’d have a good idea about the future of shopping. \u003cbr\u003eLet’s get into the details now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat’s livestream Shopping?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLivestream shopping aims at reducing the product-consumer gap that eCommerce somewhat fails to fill.\u003cbr\u003eAt a brick-and-mortar shop, consumers can check out a product directly and ask questions to the salesman about it for their peace of mind. \u003cbr\u003eWhereas, while eCommerce offers a streamlined shopping experience, consumers may not get the necessary peace of mind with some products. \u003cbr\u003eLivestream shopping is basically when an influencer or host tries to sell products through live interaction. \u003cbr\u003eThe live interaction allows the host to answer any questions that can affect consumers’ purchase decisions, improving the chances of conversions. \u003cbr\u003eThe good thing is, with livestream shopping, you don’t have to attract a new audience. You’ll be attracting the eCommerce shoppers that want a little more out of their shopping experiences. \u003cbr\u003eIt capitalizes on the ever-growing eCommerce audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy is Livestream Shopping Effective?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLivestream shopping is growing in popularity because it lets the consumers get detailed information about the products. \u003cbr\u003eJust like a physical store, consumers can get all the information they want from a livestream. And, although they can’t try the product themselves, the host can do that for them. \u003cbr\u003eLivestream shopping also leverages FOMO (fear of missing out). Because they can only claim a specific offer during a livestream, they won’t want to miss out on the opportunity. \u003cbr\u003eAnother reason why it’s proving to be so effective is that it’s a more realistic depiction of a brand and its products. \u003cbr\u003eIt allows your prospects to establish a stronger connection with your brand. Humanization of your business also makes it appear legitimate and trustworthy. \u003cbr\u003eAn interactive host will build an emotional bond with your potential customers, which will eventually lead to customer loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFuture of Livestream Shopping\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the Asian eCommerce market has been leading the livestream race, the west is also catching up. China’s market share of $1.4 Billion in 2019 is clear evidence of that. \u003cbr\u003eChina’s eCommerce giant “Alibaba” has introduced its own live shopping platform on its popular Taobao marketplace. \u003cbr\u003eA lot of brands and retailers use Taobao’s livestream platform to market their products via livestreaming. \u003cbr\u003eMoreover, creators of WeChat are also planning to invest a whopping $294 million into a livestream shopping platform of their own (Now Live). \u003cbr\u003eAlthough China has been the leader in the livestream shopping industry, many US tech companies are also following suit. \u003cbr\u003eAmazon is an eCommerce giant, and probably the most popular one out there. The platform also launched Amazon live in 2020 to leverage the power of live shopping. \u003cbr\u003eNot only that, but social media giants like Facebook and Instagram are also getting in on the action. Using Facebook and Instagram live shopping features, brands can now sell products directly to their prospects. \u003cbr\u003eEven Google has jumped on the bandwagon and introduced its own livestream shopping platform “Shoploop”. \u003cbr\u003eThe fact that popular eCommerce brands are starting to focus on livestream shopping only suggests an upward trend of this impactful marketing strategy. \u003cbr\u003eSo, livestream shopping isn’t going to go away anytime soon. The trend suggests that it’s only going to grow in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLivestream Shopping is the Future \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith eCommerce expanding its horizons and people wanting to spend less time visiting brick-and-mortar shops, the online shopping trend will only go upwards now. \u003cbr\u003eLivestream shopping goes a step ahead of eCommerce. While on an eCommerce store, prospects can browse categories and place their orders instantly, livestream shopping provides a better product-consumer interaction. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eTaobao has shown that the strategy to sell products live over the internet is not only effective but seems to be the future of shopping. \u003cbr\u003eThis is why major brands like Amazon, Instagram, and Google have created their live shopping platforms. \u003cbr\u003eIf you are thinking of starting livestreaming for your business in the future, it’s important to review your choices. \u003cbr\u003eWhile popular brands may offer you a good streaming service, you won’t have much control over several aspects of it. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eWhat you can do is, set up your own livestream. By doing that, you’ll set your brand apart from the competition. It also allows you to build your brand and control user data. \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eJumble.tv offers everything you’d need to create a smooth livestream shopping experience for your audience while having full control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith more and more businesses going online, there shouldn’t be any doubt about eCommerce being the future of shopping. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, while eCommerce allows consumers to browse the store and place orders digitally, they can’t see the product in action. \u003cbr\u003eThis is where livestream comes in handy. In livestream shopping, a host can show the product and use it in real-time. This provides the necessary peace of mind consumers need before purchasing something. \u003cbr\u003eChinese eCommerce companies have already started making good progress with livestream shopping. \u003cbr\u003eAnd, with the eCommerce giant Amazon and social media leader Facebook jumping on the bandwagon, livestream shopping seems to the future of shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
		"post-summary": "Livestream shopping aims at reducing the product-consumer gap that eCommerce somewhat fails to fill.At a brick-and-mortar shop, consumers can check out a product directly and ask questions to the salesman about it for their peace of mind. Whereas, while eCommerce offers a streamlined shopping experience, consumers may not get the necessary peace of mind with some products. Livestream shopping is basically when an influencer or host tries to sell products through live interaction. The live interaction allows the host to answer any questions that can affect consumers’ purchase decisions, improving the chances of conversions. The good thing is, with livestream shopping, you don’t have to attract a new audience. You’ll be attracting the eCommerce shoppers that want a little more out of their shopping experiences. It capitalizes on the ever-growing eCommerce audience.",

If you’ve ever wished you could transport yourself away to a Defence Against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts, then it’s likely this aesthetic is right up your street. It’s a blend of classic fashion staples with a neutral-colour palette and mysterious aura.

The aesthetic often touches on Gothic elements, with the concept of death featuring heavily within other aspects of the style outside of fashion. Dark academia was built from the sub-culture within popular social media apps like Tumblr that emphasis education above all else, with a focus on reading and learning. This sub-culture is where the ‘academia’ portion of the name comes from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhat makes dark academia different than what you might see an everyday college student wearing is its darker colour palette and gothic influence. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYour classic dark academia outfit is a crisp white shirt, dainty necklace, classic watch, tailored pants, and oxford loafers. Don’t forget to carry a book with you wherever you go! Anyone who falls into the dark academia aesthetic owns at least one pair of tweed trousers. \u003cbr\u003eMost people who follow this trend shop for their clothing second-hand to fully embrace the academic look. Most of the key pieces that make up the look are inspired by the fashion of the 1960s. In fact, most of the outfits are a more contemporary take on what was worn at Ivy League schools during the 19th century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere the Aesthetic Comes From?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve ever watched a Harry Potter film and imagined what Hogwarts would be like in real life, that’s pretty much what the dark academia aesthetic is. In fact, most people take their inspiration directly from the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter\"\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/a\u003e books and films. You’ll often see social media users pointing to characters like Hermione Granger as their style inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMost of the key fashion pieces from the series are a common sight within the dark academia aesthetic. You’ll see plenty of wool sweaters, oversized cardigans, and brown pants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou can consider the dark academia aesthetic to be the more muted sister of the preppy trend. Another way of looking at it is to think of preppy as a spring look, and dark academia as the autumn equivalent. It has the same love for argyle and crewneck sweaters. While preppy fashion focuses more on lighter colours and nautical themes, dark academia has a darker colour palette. Most people who subscribe to the dark academia look have experimented with the preppy aesthetic before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Is Dark Academia Popular?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDark Academia is a product of the pandemic. While the style had been slowly growing in popularity, it was largely considered as a niche within social media. It’s now found its way into the mainstream of fashion to become a full-blown aesthetic. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eYou could argue that the events of the pandemic have given society a more gothic vibe, which is tapped into by the dark academia aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile anyone can experiment with the dark academia, there are three groups who have a particular love for the aesthetic. The trend has been driven by high school and college students who found themselves studying from home and yearning for the comforts of the library.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt’s also popular amongst people who prefer a genderless fashion aesthetic. It’s popular amongst members of the LGBTQ+ community as it blurs gender lines and focuses on pieces that anyone can wear. Most of the inspiration for the fashion of the aesthetic comes from the menswear of 1940s, the same era when women were starting to wear trousers and experiment with more ‘masculine’ clothing for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAlthough dark academia has a ‘look’ to it, it doesn’t have the same stereotypes as other fashion aesthetic. If you subscribe to dark academia, you can still show off your personality and uniqueness in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother group who are at the heart of dark academia is the plus-size community. Arguably, dark academia is a conservative way of dressing, which often suits plus size individuals more than low-cuts and miniskirts. As the aesthetic focuses around elevated basics, you can pick up pieces from almost any store – from H\u0026amp;M to Amazon or online thrift stores.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Wear During Summer?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to assume that the dark academia aesthetic is one you can only wear in the autumn and winter. After all, it focuses primarily on a darker colour palette. While it’s easier to wear year-round in colder climates, there are still ways of making it summer appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eDuring the summer, you want to put away your thicker fabrics like wool and cashmere. Choose all-natural fabrics like cotton that are more breathable and naturally absorb moisture to keep you comfortable as the temperatures start to rise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThere are three fabrics that you want to add to your summer closet to stay within the dark academia aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLinen will keep you ventilated all summer long, and it’s a material that is minimally harm to the environment. While cotton is a popular choice, you want to search for the organic alternative as it has a lower carbon footprint and is a better choice for the environment. If you want a more elevated look, keep an eye out for vintage silk pieces. If you’re buying your silk brand-new, make an effort to find cruelty-free silk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Essential Dark Academia Pieces\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re thinking of experimenting with this aesthetic, there’s a few pieces that you’ll need for your closet. You might have some of these already, or you may need to go out and refresh your closet. If you want a ‘true’ dark academia look, it’s best to purchase your clothes vintage or pre-loved from thrift stores or online sites like Etsy or Depop. You can usually save a little money by purchasing your items second-hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eUnlike other styles, dark academia is an all-encompassing aesthetic. It’s about more than just the clothes you wear. You want to have a leather-bound book, round glasses, and handwritten letters in your bag. Your makeup looks so be more minimalistic and classic, avoiding dramatic eye makeup and instead focusing on a flawless base and a subtle lipstick colour. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThe best way of thinking about dark academia clothing is to view it as elevated basics and classic vintage pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBlouses and button-up shirts as a focal point of the look and are easy to mix and match with other pieces. They should be top of your shopping list. If you want a more formal look, don’t forget to look for blouses that have a cuffed sleeve. If you prefer a slightly more feminine twist, keep an eye out for blouses that have a peter pan colour or small intricate detailing. Silk is a go-to fabric choice for blouses and shirts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re someone who prefers skirts over trousers, you want to stick to a longer silhouette. Mini skirts aren’t considered part of the dark academia look. Instead, you want your skirts to be at least knee length – if not longer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor trousers, woold-blend and corduroy materials are a classic choice. It’s a good idea to buy a few tailored trousers that you can use as staples for your dark academia closet. If you fall in love with a vintage pair that doesn’t fit, you can take them to a seamstress to have the hem lifted and the waistband brought in for a custom fit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne staple of the aesthetic that you should have no trouble finding is a tweed blazer. When you’re taking your dark academia Instagram photos, you want to throw your blazer over your shoulders, leaving your sleeves loose and your arms out to carry your books and breakfast tea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor footwear, you want to stick to the classics. Again, you can take inspiration directly from the Harry Potter films. Consider the sort of shoes you would imagine a Hogwarts professor wearing. Boots are a classic choice and will work with anything from long skirts to cigarette trousers. If you’re a fan of wearing heels, choose a still with a block heel instead of stilettoes. While you may get away with a pair of white sneakers, you want to avoid wearing anything ‘modern’ like slides or flip flops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of the dark academia aesthetic?

If you have a deeper complexion, a lighter pomade may not appear against your skin due to your darker pigmentation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne common misconception is that you choose your eyebrow colour solely based off your hair colour. Just because you’ re brunette ,it doesn’t mean that the first brown brow wax you see if the right choice for you. The undertones of your hair are just as important. Your brunette hair might have red, caramel, or blonde undertones. These same undertones should come through in the brow colour that you choose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour hair texture can also help you decide which brow colour is right for you. If you have denser brow hairs, you’ll want to look for a colour with a darker pigment. If you have finer hair, you want to keep your eyebrows looking light with softer colour choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing worth considering is the shape and size of your forehead. If you have a smaller face, your brow colour should be on the softer side, while a larger forehead can accommodate a deeper brow colour. You want to balance out all these factors while deciding which brow colour works with your hair and skin tone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLighter is Almost Always Best\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAvoid the temptation to go for a darker colour than your natural hair shade. Ideally, you want your brow colour to be one shade lighter than your hair, while complementing the undertones of your skin. When you’re looking at the colour of your brows, you want to consider the shadow that forms between each brow hair. It’s this colour that you want to replicate through your brow products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChoosing a lighter shade will give you a more natural look, as the product will blend with your natural brow hairs to avoid an artificial look. If you choose a shade that is darker than your brows, it can look as though you’re filling in the gap between your brow hairs and the pigment can be more noticeable. If you want to avoid making it look like you’ve drawn on your brows, you want to focus on finding a lighter colour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may think that you need to find an \u003cem\u003eexact \u003c/em\u003ematch to your natural eyebrow colour – but this can be counterproductive. Using an exact match can end up making your brows appear flat, with a block shape. A lighter shade will accentuate the natural shadows of your brows, giving them added definition and avoid an artificial appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFocus on Neutral and Cool-Toned Brow Colours\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not sure which undertone to choose, it’s always best to go with a neutral or cool-toned brow shade. As a general rule, the fairer your skin is, the cooler your brow colour should be. Eyebrow colours are generally more attractive if they have a colder undertone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re struggling to choose between warm or cool tones, you can go with a safer choice. A neutral-tone light brown suits almost every skin tone or hair colour. With a taupe brown shade, you can buildup the colour to get your desired look, while adding to the density and shape of your brow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne exception is if you have a yellow undertone to your skin. In this case, you want to choose a warmer brow shade, otherwise this can give your brows an artificial or ashy grey look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a redhead, the rules are different again. You’ll fall into the one category who should always choose a warmer brow colour to match your hair. While this is true, don’t forget that the purpose of your eyebrow colour is to mimic the appearance of the shadows, and not your actual brow hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Golden Rule\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf there’s one thing you want to take away from this article, it’s the golden rule. Your brow colour should be a shade lighter(\u003cem\u003eand usually cooler) \u003c/em\u003ethan your natural brow hairs. When your brows are denser, you can get away with a heavier hand while applying your brow products.If you use a lighter shade, you can avoid giving your brows a box shape. If you have sparser eyebrows, you need to take a lighter hand with your products, as otherwise your eyebrows will appear artificial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmongst all the eyebrow trends, don’t forget how important the feature is to your face. Your brows shape your face and can change your appearance within the blink of an eye. If you find the shape and colour that works for you, stick to it. You don’t have to follow these rules, they’re not set in snow. Everyone’s complexion and skin tone has its own nuances. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour eyebrows are personal to you – after all, they’re sisters, not twins. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may take some trial and error to find the eyebrow colour that is your perfect match, but when you have it, bulk buy it! Your brow products will make or break your makeup look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat brow products do you swear by? How doyou choose your brow colour?

If you’re experiencing a breakout, or can feel one on the horizon, this gel-textured strip can help you tackle the acne right at the source. This product isn’t just empty hype, there’s science backing it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHydrocolloids are a specific type of bandage that works by absorbing excess fluids in the skin, such as oil and pus, which speeds up the recovery time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGradually, the bandages turn from a transparent colour to a speckled appearance with white spots. These spots are the impurities that your hydrocolloid bandages have absorbed from your skin. While it may seem gross in the moment, it’s great for your skin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a few hours, you can peel back the bandage to reveal beautiful spot-free skin.You don’t even have to worry about it dehydrating your skin.

If you’re planning on using hydrocolloid bandages on acne-prone skin, you probably want to avoid turning an entire packet of hydrocolloid bandages into an ill-placed sheet mask for your face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePimple patches use the same material as hydrocolloid bandages. What makes them a better choice for your skin that they’re often made using a thinner fabric and they’re infused with skin-nourishing ingredients like salicylic acid, helping you tackle your breakouts from beneath the skin. Tea tree oil is another acne-defeating ingredient that you’ll often find infused into pimple patches. They work the same way as your classic hydrocolloid bandages. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the major selling points of hydrocolloid bandages – and pimple patches – is how easy they are to use. You can place the circular patch directly over the problem area, delivering a concentrated by low-key treatment that allows you to visibly improve your skin in one go. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we love about hydrocolloid bandages is that they’re a low-key treatment. Gone are the days of wearing a zit cream that you can see from outer space. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Benefits of Hydrocolloid Bandages \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hydrocolloid bandage blends in with your skin and is hardly noticeable to the naked eye. You might even forget it’s there yourself! If you’re someone who has a bad habit of picking at their face, this inventive little skincare product can stop you from touching imperfections and spots. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, this factor is a major selling point for hydrocolloid bandages. They’re one of the only (\u003cem\u003eif not the only!) \u003c/em\u003etreatment that physically prevents from your picking at your face. While picking at your face might feel great in the moment, it’ll irritate your skin and often make your breakout even worse. Every time you pick at your acne or pimple, it causes inflammation around the area and slows down the healing process. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re in a hurry to get your skin back to its glowing pre-acne days, then hydrocolloid bandages are an absolute must-have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike other acne-tackling products, hydrocolloid bandages start out clear, meaning you could wear them all day long. You could slip them on your face before running to the grocery store or heading into the office to grab your files. It’s a no-nonsense acne treatment that allows you to go about your day without thinking about your acne. There’s more important things to spend your time thinking about than whether anyone is going to be staring at the zit on your face when you go into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e9 times out of 10, they won’t be – but hydrocolloid bandages will conceal your imperfections, while tackling them at the same time. It’s the perfect two in one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to Use Hydrocolloid Bandages\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of our favourite things about hydrocolloid bandages is that you can use them over your makeup. Usually, we think of makeup as something that can slow down the skin’s healing process – and offer flare up our acne or breakouts. With hydrocolloid bandages, you can still enjoy a full face of makeup without having to worry about your spots or acne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a free bird and can choose when to use your hydrocolloid bandages, we recommend incorporating them into your night-time routine. Yep, the best time to wear your hydrocolloid bandages are when you’re fast asleep. Night-time is when your skin is working overnight to repair and rejuvenate itself from the events of the day. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stickiness of the hydrocolloid bandages mean that you don’t have to worry about your plasters moving throughout the night if you’re someone who tosses and turns while you sleep. If you’re planning to utilize these handy little patches at night-time, you want to make sure you’re using them as part of your skincare routine to get the best results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat should you have in your acne-prone skincare routine?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have acne-prone skin, you want to kickstart your routine with a mild cleanser. This product removes dead skin cells that are blocking your pores, along with impurities and dirt. These are the most common causes of blackheads and blemishes. You’re usually best to avoid cleansers that specifically market themselves as an ‘\u003cem\u003eacne cleanser’, \u003c/em\u003eas they’re often too harsh for your skin and strip it of its natural oils. Instead, invest in a sulfrate-free mild cleanser that will remove impurities from your skin without irritating it. The purpose of cleansing is to help open your skin and make it easier for it to absorb the active ingredients in your other skincare products – including your hydrocolloid bandages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter you’ve cleansed, you want to follow through with a toner. This product is one that’s often been given an unfair rep as an irritating product. When you have dry skin, you want to be incorporating a hydrating toner into your routine to help regulate your skin’s moisture and to rehydrate your skin. The best way of applying toner is with a cotton ball and by gently massaging the residue into your skin and neck. Your toner will catch any leftover dead skin cells or dirt that your cleanser missed, making it a must-have for anyone with acne-prone skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsually, we would now recommend going in with your treatment products, like serums and oils. If you have any, you can add them in at this stage onto freshly cleansed skin. If you’re looking to give your skin some TLC at this stage, you can add in a gua shu or jade roller to help improve your lymphatic drainage and stimulate cellular turnover to brighten your complexion. We recommend using either of these in partnership with a facial serum or oil, instead of applying it directly to dry skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you’ll be using hydrocolloid bandages as a treatment you could save time and skip the ‘\u003cem\u003etreatment’ \u003c/em\u003estage here and save it for later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best ways to tackle acne-prone skin is to keep it hydrated and moisturised. Hydrated skin equals happy face. If you have an oily skin type (\u003cem\u003eas most acne-prone people do), \u003c/em\u003eyou may have accepted the common misconception that your body doesn’t need any more moisture than it currently has. In fact, the opposite is true. It's highly likely your skin is producing excess sebum to make up for its moisture deficiency. Using a moisturizer will help improve your skin’s moisture retention and give it a nourishing boost of hydration. Whatever your skin type is, moisturizer is a must. This product seals the skin and locks in the benefits of the moisturiser, while boosting your skin’s natural protective barrier to prevent any moisture loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNormally, this is where we would recommend finishing your routine, but we’re adding an addition step just for you. As part of your night-time routine, you want to leave hydrocolloid bandages as the final step of your routine. These little innovative patches are becoming more mainstream – you can even find them in grocery stores, as well as high-end department stores. Whatever your budget is, there’s a hydrocolloid bandage out there that is promising to give you the results you’re after.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you have acne prone skin, less is more. This fact is why we recommend that you limit your other treatment products while using your hydrocolloid bandages. In most cases, they’ll work find by themselves, and you’ll usually enjoy a window seat to look of during take-off and arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike other skincare products, you can use these blemish patches whenever you feel that your skin needs a touch-up or a pick-me-up. Usually, you have to use a product for up at least six weeks to see a drastic change. With a hydrocolloid bandage, you can see the results almost instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe best way to get the most out of your hydrocolloid bandages are to stick to a consistent skincare routine (\u003cem\u003eboth morning and night!) \u003c/em\u003ethat focuses on addressing your acne-prone skin type. While hydrocolloid bandages are great, you want to improve the overall health of your skin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that we’ve found hydrocolloid bandages, they’re one essential that live in our everyday bag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think our hydrocolloid bandages?

Minimalism is everywhere you look, but it doesn’t mean you have to stick to a neutral colour palette. If you’re someone who has a classic aesthetic or you’re dedicated to a capsule closet, adding a few elevated basics can give your closet an updated feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want to keep an eye out for heritage blazers, trench coats, and blazers with a vintage feel.

In fact, Gen Z have cancelled skinny jeans. It doesn’t mean you have to turn your back on denim –rather the opposite. Instead of choosing figure hugging denim that ends up making you feel bloated, invest in a pair of loose-fitting denim jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rise of this trend is partly due to our new-found love for comfort driven fashion. If you’re a fan of the 70s aesthetic, loose jeans are an easy way to incorporate it into your spring/summer 2021 closet. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChoose a pair of high-waisted jeans to see you through the season. You can style them with everything from crop tops to oversized hoodies and sneakers or slides. Silhouettes to look out for include boyfriend fit, flared jeans, and bootcut jeans. If you still prefer a more tailored look, a high-rise straight-leg jean is a great way of embracing the trend without having to choose flared jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile denim comes in almost every colour, you want to keep it classic with a blue-wash denim. These lighter shades are the perfect choice for spring and summer. You want to avoid dark wash or black denim until later in the year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf jeans aren’t your thing, you can add denim to your spring/summer 2021 closet with a dress or jacket. Denim is becoming one of the must-have fabrics for your closet.

We all found ways to cope – whether it was with cookies or a few extra snacks throughout the day.Lockdown meant that the gyms were forced to shut for months, which may have derailed your fitness goals. With the world slowly starting to reopen again, everyone is trying to think of ways to fit back into their skinny jeans. The first thing you want to remember is that your body saw you through a pandemic –an unthinkable event that we thought belonged in the first books. Keep this in mind while you’re working on getting back your pre-pandemic body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlong with skipping the gym, we’ve all been guilty of forgetting about our beauty routine. When was the last time you put on a full face of makeup? It’s all gathering dust at the bottom of our vanity drawer. Getting your pre-lockdown body back is about more shedding the extra weight. Don’t forget about getting back into your tanning routine or jumping back into using skincare products. Whether you’re looking to get your body ‘\u003cem\u003esummer ready’ \u003c/em\u003eor help shift a few pounds, we’re rounding up our top five tips forgetting back your pre-lockdown body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eProducts to Tone Up Your Legs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery fitness instructor will tell you it’s impossible to target your weight loss, but you can tone up specific areas of your body. Sometimes, exercise isn’t enough to firm and tone your legs. You’ll want to pick up a few products to help you along the way. Body contouring is a trend that is starting to make its way into the mainstream, whether it’s with non-invasive treatments or at-home beauty products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome products that you want to look out for include the Sisley’s Le Sculpteur, a best-selling product that uses caffeine, pink berry oil, and white ginger to help de-puff and streamline your skin.It’ll give you a nourishing boost of hydration at the same time!

While it’s a pre-tanning essential, a body scrub can help exfoliate dead skin cells and stimulate your blood circulation. Using a scrub as part of your regular body care routine can also help you tackle cellulite by diminishing its appearance. If cellulite is a concern, you want to search for a scrub that incorporates coffee grounds or a caffeine product. When you’re applying your scrub, make sure to work in circular motions to help plump up your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDetoxify with an Infrared Sauna\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCelebrities like Kim Kardashian and GwynethPaltrow have all raved about infrared saunas as a way to detoxify you body and revitalise your mind. These at-home saunas cause your body to produce more healthy hormones like dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin. This magic trio reduces your stress levels and makes it easier for you to fall asleep. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStepping into an infrared sauna has the same effect on your heart as going for a moderate ride on an exercise bike. All you need is 25 minutes in a sauna to start seeing a visible difference. You can book in for one at your local health spa or invest in an at-home infrared sauna blanket. While this product is an investment, it’s a game changer for your wellness routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost gyms and fitness centres offer sauna facilities.If you’re heading back to your spin class or taking a dip in the pool, you can usually get access to a sauna facility that way. It’ll make your gym membership even more worth it. You can work on your fitness goals and then pop into the sauna to focus on your wellness. These two go hand in hand, even more so post-lockdown as our lives slowly return back to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMeet the Alternative to a Massage\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to depuff your skin and help shift the last few stubborn pounds.

If you want to treat yourself to a post-lockdown massage, you should consider one that targets your lymphatic system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first things you should book in for after lockdown is a massage. The last year has took a toll on our body – you’ve probably got knots on top of knots. Treat yourself after the yar from hell by indulging in a massage. Most spas and salons will be offering special deals to attract people back into their stores. You can add on other treatments to your massage to target specific skin concerns. You could go one step further and add-on a facial to give your skin some TLC as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSplurge on Body Contouring\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the salons and spas starting to reopen, it’s never been a better time to splurge on a treatment. Celebrities are all fans of body contouring treatments, which put your body through an intense workout with you having to lift a finger. One of the most famous treatments is the Emsculpt NEO – the most advanced on the market. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese treatments deliver the equivalent of around20,000 crunches or squats to your body, using a combination or electromagnetic energy and radio frequency stimulation. It would take you a \u003cem\u003elot \u003c/em\u003elong to get through that many squats. This treatment gives you the same effects as an intense workout routine, lifting and sculpting your limbs. It’s also a great treatment to invest in if you have an active lifestyle as it will strengthen your muscles to reduce your risk of injury.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it has the same effect on your body as 20,000 manual crunches, it’ll help reduce the fat in your body. While this treatment is expensive, it’s worth investing in if you have a big event coming up in the next few months, like a wedding or milestone birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have a beauty therapist or dermatologist, it’s worth speaking to them to them to see if they have a specific recommendation or offer a similar body sculpting treatment. These procedures are becoming more common, with cheaper alternatives reaching the market. If you decide to invest in one of these treatments, make sure you do your due diligence and work with a qualified technician or therapist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFake Tan is Your BFF\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe all know the dangers of sitting out in the sun– and sunbeds are just as bad. If you want to give your skin a healthy glow, the best way it from a body. You don’t need to book in for a spray tan to have an overnight transformation. It can all come from a bottle. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re planning on fake tanning, don’t overlook the importance of using a body scrub first to remove dead skin cells and impurities. When your skin surface is more even, you’ll get a better application of your tan, without any uneven patches. It’s a good idea to look for a body scrub that includes hydrating ingredients like salicylic and lactic acids to life and tone your skin. After scrubbing, you want to add a layer of moisturiser to the areas of your body that your tanner tends to gather up. At a minimum, you want to moisturise your elbows, hands, feet, and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you’re ready to go, take your fake tan and apply it with a mitt, working in circular motions. Within a few hours, it’ll look like you spent lockdown in paradise instead of your bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t forget about your face.

Creativity knows no end and will never be a competition. Domineering in the chase to produce the most trendy might be a high and hard to reach standard to set, but true authentic creation that comes from one’s unique perception of beauty, does not know limits. The saturation of e-commerce markets might be frightening for the creatives and retailers, but if thought about, there is a buyer for everything created. However, this saturation only is a natural result in a field that welcomes creation. If one is truly passionate about something, is consistent in following through and becoming the best they can be, results will show and be seen. There are plenty of ways to market the products and plenty of audience that is going to love it.

Numerous platforms that allow for collaboration and co-creation with link-minded, visionary people. By aligning the tasks assigned to create the vision of desire to the people with similar values and different approaches to get the most perspectives possible, you can get the most out of something that starts as an idea, give it the momentum and structure it needs. All types of people out there are offering to share all types of skills, which gives an opportunity for you and your business to evolve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe old system of sweating away your time to survive will be present for a long time, but at least we are living through an age where choosing how you make money is less of a luxury choice and is accessible thanks to the vast opportunities and knowledge the internet offers.

The more small brands and entrepreneurs there are around the world, the more options these retailers will have, meanwhile the awareness and pressure put on the big brands is making them act in a more ethical way.

Created by humans after all, it has taken all the faculties of analysis and pattern notice, perfecting it through trial and fail method. Extensive use of data analysis is needed to read the needs and interests of customers, imagine how fast the accuracy of AI grows, the more data there is available. Although it does not become the sole solution of industry challenges and problems like those of wastage in the beauty industry, it is definitely giving a huge hand in figuring out the right approach to more efficient and less damaging sales. Here we will explore how AI can optimize different sides of the fashion industry:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking through smart algorithms and scanning information for particular areas in question, AI requires big data for accuracy. Big leaders in the industry do not have a problem with providing that, hence can get the most of the tool available. When we think of AI, we mostly think of smart chatbots, a big part of customer experience optimisation, and lately all of us have definitely heard of the fashion weeks held online. However, AI offers much more than that, and most of the impact it has had on the industry has been extremely efficient, yet remains subtle for the eye. Working to understand customers shopping habits and personal interest, purchase patterns and knowing all about your shopping history, it allows the brands to get a better idea of where your future interaction with industry is going, imagine when this is the case of understanding millions of potential customers. In no case it is replacing the creative aspect of fashion - there will never stop being a need for the inspired and the visionaries. However, seeing how basing the product production has been based on intuitive understanding of the audience's future interest, it is fair to say that the supply-demand predictions have been off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest problem with this 3 trillion dollar industry is that a huge fraction of the creations sold ends up being never worn and thrown away. Although completely clean and organic production all over the world is an impossible standard for the times we will live to see, it is definitely a fair concern to be raised over the environmental effects of the industry’s methods. What a huge fraction of those effects can be cut down, if only all that which was necessary and put to use ended up in the hands of clients? This is where AI’s brilliance comes in. The fact that it can predict the future patterns and demand for different inventory, not only the companies’ economy will benefit from unsold inventory costs, but the world from having less go to waste.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe constantly changing needs of customers, fast fashion with its seasonal offers, requires for brands to throw out collections every month or even every week. Data analysis can help organize the collection in a more efficient way, expecting a higher rate of sales. By integrating the insights about the customers, items are created with a certainty of desire and need. From the type of the product, to its texture color and size, brands are moving away from the historical trial and error to a calculated, less error more facts approach. The external influences that come into play to shape and redirect trends and what is in, is a whole different discussion, AI focuses merely on the past and current flow and quantity of interest, for a near term future. It is not to direct fashion, but to optimize the experience for the brands, clients and the planet, in many different ways. The brands turn up their sales, customers get what they want, planet remains, or shall we say gets into a healthy condition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe journey of product creation to customer experience of the brand to post-purchase services, all of these parts have been upturned by what AI has to offer. Brands can optimize their marketing services by knowing what their target audience is like and better targeting this audience. From search engines to actual e-shops, there has been personal adaptation by likeliness of compatibility for each user. We might not notice how huge this is, but we all have noticed an ad come up across all platforms we use with an ad section, for what we like after we mentioned it somewhere or something we definitely would like. This ensures that the products are better reached by those who would want them and are less likely to go to waste. It also means that when we search for items, we are confronted by less options we do not want to see, for an oversaturated market this function comes in very handy for both parties. The process is more convenient, faster and less demanding of our research capabilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest advantages of AI is its capability to automatically perform simpler mundane tasks, replacing labor that in many cases is taking place in poor conditions, unethically distributed roles to minors and with unfair wages. Machines, or robots, can perform certain tasks like sewing, cutting and stitching materials for a creation of less intricate pieces. Many brands are using its analysis of customer’s tastes and put it to use from design step to manufacturing. It can style, providing possibilities to have a virtual trial of a piece. During the times of the pandemic with its lockdowns, we might all miss the full shopping experience. Although it might not apply to high fashion, it definitely is a foundation brick for the production process for retailers and brands of the future. It might cost to integrate AI and such technologies, but long-term results outweigh the present challenges. The closest it gets to real shopping, machines are becoming capable of replacing the duties of many role players in the industry, all the while optimizing it on all levels. Efficient, interactive, personal, this technology’s effects on the quality of the industry and its relationship with the users, while also minimizing the unsustainable methods used prior, can astonish any user, and this is the future we will come across in the mainstream very soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

In fact, if you take a look at the ingredients list of luxury skincare brands, you’ll quickly realise that gold isn’t that unusual of a skincare product after all. It’s main benefit is that it works to stimulate your collagen production to help prevent premature ageing by leaving the skin plumper and firmer. While anti-ageing is something that we could all do with thinking about, gold also offers some short-term benefits for your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the time that you’ll hear people talking about gold face masks is when they invest in one before a special event. Gold works to improve the microcirculation of your skin, energising your cells to leave you with a radiant glow from within. Gold is a natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, treating skin infections and soothing acne-prone skin. Using gold in your skincare products can help support the skin’s natural renewal process, which happens on a 28-day cycle. Gold can also work in partnership with other ingredients to create a more potent effect for active ingredients, allowing you to get the most out of your skincare products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAre They Worth The Hype?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might want to invest in a gold face mask just to take a selfie in it, but it’s worthy of the Instagram hype around it. As gold is a versatile ingredient, you can find it in a myriad of different face mask formulas and types.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want a face mask to help with anti-ageing, try an in-salon 24k pure gold treatment to smooth your skin, diminish the appearance of wrinkles, and give you an instant face lift. Gold leaf can help your skin better absorb the other products in your face mask.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can also come across gold as an ingredient in sheet masks, which is a favourite pre-show treatment for supermodels at fashion week shows. A gold sheet mask will help freshen up your skin, soothing our any irritation and imperfections, while also restoring the skin’s moisture levels. You can even skip your moisturizer after using a gold sheet mask.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking to achieve a naturally dewy glow from within, you need to start investing in face masks with gold particles.

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eThe fashion industry is the cause for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions, with fast fashion coming out with a new collection every week to satisfy our insatiable needs, most of which we never wear. By 2030, there will likely be 149 million tons of waste from the fashion industry, with 3 out of 5 new pieces of clothing being thrown away. The industry is only supplying the high demand created globally, with labor exploitation still being common as a humanity, we are not doing a good job of thinking before acting. Our rash decisions based on the need to satisfy beauty standards are causing harm not only to the planet and the wildlife, but on the health of those living next to the dump piles. Holistic, organic fashion is really to become the next trend, with the accessibility to different methods to deal with this issue. Here are some ideas on how to create a wardrobe filled with loved pieces, that will bring you joy for many seasons:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHandmade pieces\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA wonderful way to support small businesses during a tough time like now, buying handmade pieces gives you the possibility to have pieces created that scream YOU. The uniqueness that comes with all different types of home-made pieces of clothing that are available on marketplaces like Etsy, will leave you more than satisfied with. The manufacturing process of making a polyester shirt for example, has 2 times more carbon footprint than a cotton one. Considering how much water is used to make a pair of jeans - 7 000 litres, a handmade piece leaves all of that out, opening the possibilities of creating custom pieces, where you choose the material and design. Acquisition of these pieces cuts down the chance you will get tired of it and will want to throw it away. Although costlier in some cases than typical retail, the organic way of making it, uniqueness of design and love put into all steps of the way makes it highly worth it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a time of a pandemic, fortunately social media has been blooming with creative and inspired talents, putting their works out there not for big-scaling, but for the sake of loving to do it. For example, knit-ware is a wonderful way to add a hipster colorful touch to your wardrobe. Easy to repair, extremely open to variations of design and thread, there is not one item that cannot be made from threads, from scarfs to coats to cosy homeware. There are cardigans and dresses made from a gentle, soft thread, there are intricate patterns on your new favourite chic cosy sweater. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eConscious and slow fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEthical, cruelty-free and organic are the 3 pillars of positive impact fashion. A company or brand that creates their pieces consciously, will display how they approach the manufacturing process through the choice of materials, their acquisition and the treatment of their workers. You know a company has something to hide when you do not find information about these important factors unless you write to them directly. It might be a good idea to have a look into your favourite brands philosophies and approaches to product creation, to get a better understanding of what you have been supporting and ponder on what you want to support.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is known that many clothes are made by underpaid and often underage desperate to survive workers, you closing your eyes on this when you purchase leads to normalisation of this treatment. Pushing forward awareness of more holistic fashion methods puts pressure on the brands and retailers to better the working conditions and terms. Cruelty-free means that no animals were hurt in the process of manufacturing, while organic fashion means that highly toxic and harmful pesticides were avoided during the growth of plants for production of pure fibres.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;A lot of big brands like Zara and H\u0026amp;M are starting to incorporate conscious collections into their sellstream, although definitely behind many others like Everlane and Levi’s. Jeans manufacturing requires the most water supply out of all garments and a brand like Levi’s has taken the conscious approach so seriously that they found a way to decrease water consumption in the process by 96%. You can start with conscious shopping by keeping in mind that what you buy is more than just a piece to put on and do the necessary research beforehand.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBiodegradable materials and low impact dyes used in garments means that when the piece has finished serving you, if it is not in state to be passed on or sold to someone, it will not be an excess pollution addition. Another way to deal with unneeded pieces is giving them another purpose, or up-cycling. Garments can become kitchen napkins, rags and furniture covers. Slow fashion is the philosophy that combines ethics with sustainability by producing garments respectfully and often in house, to cut down on transportation and production cost and effects, while keeping the collections small. The goal is to reduce waste post sales and offer you a piece that will ideally last a lifetime. Choosing quality over quantity is more expensive in the short-term, saves you money and the planet's health long term. Keeping in mind that there are numerous brands which are creating with integrity and morals, you are left with a wide selection instead of the typical go-to brands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRent or swap pieces\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe widespread notion of mistake buys has given rise to another side of the fashion market, clothes renting. From platforms on which you can rent and rent out privately owned pieces on a monthly basis, to platforms where runway pieces and smaller brands offer the most unique selections. Have a fancy event to attend but want to spare on a lux dress? Check out Style Land, you can get a membership and select the pieces you love and even purchase them if you change your mind on returning it. Make money on your bad decisions and reduce your carbon footprint!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the idea of wearing someone else’s worn clothes with personal history might freak some people out unless it is a you-won’t-find-anywhere-else old model, there are really some gems out there which have never been worn and are waiting for your attention and their turn to serve. You can find completely new or one-time worn clothes in absolute perfect condition, for a much smaller price than a store one - thank you depreciation! It is only reasonable to have a glance through some e-shops like Vintedd and Depop. Many people make brands out of items they picked out on their scavenger hunt, creating truly unique collections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

As a brand, what will be directly under your control to prepare beforehand, will be the set-up with the equipment, the host, the knowledge of the products, the order and the discounts they will come with. Being open to spontaneity is a very important factor, but here we propose you some questions to explore, to be morally ready for hypothetical situations that will come up.

Give them a taste of it, by demonstrating its use and commentating your responses and thoughts, so they can put themselves in your shoes. Complete transparency gains an upper hand as a marketing strategy, compared to filtered and edited advertisements.

You want to change up the rhythm, not get too pushy on buying, not spend too much time on product presentation. Your audience will correlate the decision to buy if you sell the idea well and that will be formed by the experience you offer.

After all, we are practically living in our loungewear 24/7. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want the slim fit of skinny jeans without being seen as wearing last season’s trends, opt for a pair of cigarette jeans.

Now, we’re focused on reading the ingredients in products and asking about their environmental impact. ‘Green Beauty’ is products that focus on natural and organic ingredients. These brands are quickly dominating the beauty industry. In 2019, the UK saw a \u003ca href=\"https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/best-sustainable-beauty-for-earth-day-695114\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e23%\u003c/a\u003e increase in sales of organic and natural beauty products. Their popularity shows no sign of slowing down on either side of the pond, with demand growing for natural beauty products. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re all aware of our carbon footprint and the impact that consumer behaviour has on the world around us. We’re also more aware of the ingredients in our products. Thanks to YouTube, it’s never been easier to know which skin irritants to avoid and what green beauty products are worth your hard-earned money. Green beauty is products that are kind to your skin and the world around us. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWait, isn’t ‘green beauty’ the same as ‘clean beauty’? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNot exactly. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreen beauty is a term used for products which only use natural or naturally derived ingredients. It’s generally seen as the most environmentally friendly type of beauty products, as it cuts out artificial ingredients and chemical add-ins. You’ll often find green beauty products labelled as ‘vegan’. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClean beauty is different from green beauty as it focuses on avoiding irritating or harmful ingredients. You will still find synthetic ingredients in your ‘clean beauty’ products, along with a mixture of natural ingredients. Your clean beauty products will not focus on naturally derived ingredients, but on how ingredients react on the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe green beauty revolution has come around due to consumer demand for more natural ingredients. In the early to mid-2000s, it wasn’t unusual for most mainstream beauty products to have chemical ingredients in them. The change happened in 2013 after the \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/400-lipstick-brands-contain-lead-fda-says/2012/02/14/gIQAhOyeDR_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFDA revealed\u003c/a\u003e that over 400 types of lipsticks contained small amounts of lead. Since then, we’ve become more aware of the ingredients we’re putting on our skin. Green beauty has evolved out of the demand for natural products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reality is that we often have no idea what we’re putting on our skin or in our hair. Unless you’re a chemist, the ingredients list of a product will read like a foreign language. There are still chemicals that are popular in beauty products that hadn't enough research carried out on them. Not only are certain chemicals harmful for us, but they can also damage the environment. At the start of 2021, \u003ca href=\"https://www.hawaii.com/blog/reef-safe-sunscreen/#:~:text=Hawaii%20is%20the%20first%20state,non%2Dreef%20safe%20sun%20protection.\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHawaii’s ban\u003c/a\u003e on chemical sunscreens came into effect to protect coral reef life.

It is not a topic we see debated often, but we expect to see that change as we move more firmly into a more technologically driven era. If you are curious about beauty biotech and what it all means, then keep reading!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst things first, what is beauty biotechnology? Well before we get to that, let’s talk about the movement towards greener beauty options. The modern consumer cares tremendously about the quality of ingredients used in their products—these days it’s not enough to just say ‘natural’ or ‘organic’, you have to identify how and where your products have been sourced, whether they are made from renewable resources, how much energy it takes to produce them etc. And while this is all great news, the truth is, it takes a whole bunch of natural resources to ethically manufacture or harvest many of the ingredients we love in our skincare products because they are literally coming from the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is where beauty biotech comes into play. Beauty biotechnology broadly refers to DNA editing using organisms like bacteria or algae to produce ingredients. Often it basically means that the ingredients are being made in the lab using some combination of natural ingredients and synthetic chemicals to produce more sustainable solutions for the ingredients we know and love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy is this important? Well basically, we need to rethink what we consider ‘green beauty’. Because while the ingredients might be natural, organic or otherwise plant-based and high quality, ‘going green’ doesn’t stop there. We have to think of the way these ingredients make it into our favorite products—is there a lengthy global supply chain? Does the harvesting or farming process involve extensive extraction and how would this affect the ingredient’s carbon footprint? Does the extraction process require significant energy inputs? Phew! A lot to consider!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeauty biotechnology helps with all of these factors, making it a more sustainable option. It also results in greater consistency; since the ingredient is developed in a lab, you don’t have the same level of concern about impurities or potency. You also know exactly how and where your ingredient is produced, which removes any ethical concerns about the way many of these ingredients are farmed, as well as questions about the global supply chain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, for many, ingredients grown in a lab sounds like the opposite of natural, however this is not necessarily the case. Consider beauty biotech as the way to create natural, sustainable solutions for certain ingredients utilizing organisms. Though an emerging industry, one can expect it to play an important role in both the beauty and environmental industries alike!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

But on the other hand, we want to present our best self, even if it is via Zoom! Whether you have an important meeting, a job interview or maybe even a Zoom date, you want your makeup to translate virtually. The good news, it doesn’t mean you have to overdo your look or pile on the makeup, just a few tweaks can make a huge difference.

Even if you aren’t wearing any other makeup, your brows help to frame your face and give it a nice even look. You don’t even need to do too much as we are seeing a softer brow becoming more popular. However, you definitely should do something with your eyebrows, whether it is just brushing them through with a spoolie and defining with a bit of concealer or taking your brow product of choice and doing your entire brow routine (and if you don’t have one, \u003ca href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/best-eyebrow-tips\"\u003eclick on this link\u003c/a\u003e!).

The bold color will make a huge statement and it’s also a fun way to boost your mood. There aren’t any rules to this either—if you feel like trying out a new lip color every day of the week then go right ahead (In our opinion, a bright, matte red lip is always a good place to start!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMascara (but no liner)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eFor those big, beautiful doe eyes that catch the light, even via a compture webcam, mascara is your best friend. Choose a fairly neutral shadow as your base, and then amp up the mascara! A few coats of your favorite lash product will really make a big difference in your Zoom makeup look. And while it may be tempting, skip the eyeliner this time. Eyeliner can sometimes make your eyes look smaller and what you want is to give that wide-eyed look that really draws the viewer in (and makes you look more awake in case you were up bingeing Netflix all night)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSunkissed skin\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSure we might be indoors a lot more right now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t embrace beautiful, luminous skin. There’s no need t use foundation if you aren’t in the mood (and to be honest, who is these days?) A tinted moisturizer will suffice, a it adds both moisture and some color to your skin. Then play around with your favorite highlighter—dust it across your cheekbones, nose bridge and even around the perimeter of your face.

With the help of AHA, aqua peel removes all the dead skin cells and toxins from your face. It removes whiteheads, blackheads, and dead skin layers. After that, a suction tool is used to extract all the impurities and dirt from deep within the pores. BHA works in the same way the only difference is that AHA can easily dissolve in water. This means AHA can easily remove impurities from the skin. On the other hand, BHA can only dissolve in oil. BHA is used on oily areas on the face like T-zone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of this cleansing removes natural oil and moisture from the face along with the impurities. So once the face is clean, it is then time to add moisture back to your face. Different elements are used for moisturizing the skin. This last step makes sure that the skin will feel hydrated and alive. This process normally takes 30-35 minutes and the effects will last up to 4-6 weeks. You will immediately see the difference in your skin.

But what exactly does dermaplaning do? Dermaplaning is a cosmetic operation that involves removing the epidermis by scratching the face with a scalpel. It is an act of shaving that removes the outer layer of your face called the epidermis. It removes peach fuzz and small hair on the face. People used to go to a dermatologist or a specialist to get this procedure done. Now, there are a lot of options available in the market for at-home derma planning use. The main purpose is to reduce fine lines and acne scarring. Dermaplaning brightens up skin tone and adds smoothness to your face. This is a non-invasive, completely pain-free procedure that can be done at home by yourself. There are no serious side effects or risks related to dermaplaning. The results last up to 2-3 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this procedure, dead skin cells along with peach fuzz and hairs are removed with help of an exfoliating tool. The exfoliating blade is gently dragged on the face in a downward motion. Since it works as an exfoliating agent, it removes all the impurities and dirt from the skin. When the outer layer (dead skin cells) is shed, new skin will appear on the surface. This makes your skin look fresh, healthy, and youthful. Dermaplaning, which uses a blade to gently exfoliate dead skin from the face, is one of the trendiest hair removal solutions today. The skin is evened out by removing the dead layer and hair from the face. It helps with the regeneration of cells, which aids fresh skin to resurface.

For years, people across the globe have used these remarkable facial cupping techniques for rejuvenation and skincare benefits. Facial cupping is intended to increase the circulation of the blood and stimulate the facial cells responsible to produce collagen. It helps to minimize the appearance of acne scars, wrinkles, and fine lines. Cupping is an alternative treatment that strengthens the skin and muscles using suction cups. Lifting the facial tissue triggers lymphatic drainage to remove impurities, cell debris, and excess fluid. Suction helps enhance blood circulation, which can help alleviate muscle pain and facilitate cell regeneration. Qi is a Chinese term that means the force of life. It is also said to enhance your \"qi\" (pronounced \"chee\") flow. This amazing face-lifting technique helps de-puff and tone your face and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFacial cupping is like body cupping, but they don’t leave marks behind. The only difference is that face cups are relatively smaller and softer. It's used to gently draw the skin away from deeper layers of your face. Facial cupping increases blood flow to the region and brightens the skin. This technique benefits the skin over time and reduces age spots and acne scars. Body cupping, on the other hand, is used mainly to relieve pains and soreness. Body cupping also leaves marks on the body, that fades away with time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFacial Cupping Technique: How to Do it Like a Pro?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first thing you need to do is to determine your skin type. Sensitive skin types require a lot of precautions and extra attention. Cleanse your face with a foaming cleanser to know your skin type. With acne-prone skin make sure to use oils that will help calm down redness and swelling. Use rich oils or face moisturizer before face cupping, so that cup easily glides over your face without leaving any facial marks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSqueeze the cup to create a little suction. Place it on your face and gently glide it over your face. Blood is pulled into the skin region through the suction effect. This infuses the surrounding tissue with fresh blood and encourages new production of blood vessels. Cupping often induces sterile inflammation. The vacuum-like suction extracts different layers of tissue and causes microtrauma and tearing. This triggers an allergic response, and the area is overwhelmed with white blood cells and platelets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour skin may feel a little temperature sensitive after cupping. Make sure that you avoid a hot bath, saunas, and intense exercise. To stop reintroducing unnecessary toxins to the skin, shower with clean water if possible. To drain out excess chemicals, toxins, and excess water, make sure to drink lots of water. Your skin will require time to heal, make sure that you stay away from alcohol for 4-5 hours of post-treatment. Apply some calming aloe and wait until your next cupping appointment until your skin has healed. Don't over-exfoliate. A coating of dead skin is eliminated by exfoliating, which makes the skin extra delicate. Make sure that you haven't exfoliated your skin before going to the clinic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat are the Benefits of Face Cupping?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e· \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Face cupping increases blood circulation, which promotes skin brightness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e· \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;It helps fight acne scars, wrinkles, and fine lines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e· \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Facial cupping removes dark circles and de-puff your eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e· \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Cupping helps reduce stress and muscle tension.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e· \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Facial cupping aids the process of collagen production.

The suggested initial course of facial cupping therapy includes between 6 and 12 hours. To maintain the original results, we suggest monthly follow-up sessions. Do it at night on smooth, oiled skin, which relaxes your face muscles. Facial cups are not meant to leave marks. Bruising may occur, however, if the cup is left for too long in the same position. Minor side effects may occur following treatment, and occasional cases of dizziness, nausea, and some facial pains have been documented by individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat are the Risks and Side Effects of Facial Cupping?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough facial cupping is usually considered healthy, it is possible to have mild side effects. Usually, they develop during or shortly after the procedure. You can feel temporary dizziness,lightheadedness, nausea, and cold sweating. Your facial cupping therapy starts after a mild face and neck massage. It is safest to come with long hair pulled back and a clean face for your procedure. A standard procedure for facial rejuvenation lasts 30 minutes but extra spa time may be provided upon request.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAt-Home Facial Cupping\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting it done by a professional makes sure that you get the maximum results out of this procedure. But if you are thinking of doing your facial cupping then make sure that you learn the basics. There are a lot of facial cupping kits available in the market that you can choose from. There are different cups available in the market like plastic and gel-like cup. Choose according to your personal preference. Wash your face first and pat dry it. Apply a thin layer of oil is the key as it helps the cup to easily glide over your skin. Make sure that you apply an oil that matches your skin type and requirements. If you have sensitive skin, we recommend coconut oil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBottom line is that facial cupping improves blood circulation and can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, reduce puffiness, and more. Facial muscles benefit immensely from the removal of stress, tension, and the loosening of stiff muscle tissue. Facial cupping may have important clinical outcomes for conditions linked to sinus infections, inflammation, edema, and those with TMJ disorders. At home, you can try facial cupping, but with your first session, it would be better to reach out to a professional. They will answer any questions you may have and provide further advice on your skincare needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eFake tans always come in handy when you want a sun-kissed look, but the question is how to choose the perfect shade for your skin type? There is a lot of fake tans available in the market for different skin type. Choosing which tan will compliment your natural skin color is the real struggle. Before we jump into the basics of fake tan let's take a look at what is made of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDHA (Dihydroxyacetone) is the main ingredient found in fake tan. It was discovered by German scientists in late 1920. Researchers discovered that if the DHA is poured onto the body, it colored the surface of the skin brown. No one knew that it would forever transform the face of modern cosmetics. Later in the 1950s researchers discovered that it only colored the outer layer of the skin. It was completely harmless and non-toxic. It was then approved to be used in the cosmetic industry. This is how fake tan found its way into the beauty industry and became popular over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the product contains a lot of DHA then the resulting color would be a dark brown. If you are looking for a subtle tan then look for the product that has less quantity of DHA. The higher the level of DHA, the darker the tan would be. You can also layer up your tan to get the perfect tan that you want. Fake tan takes its time to develop. It can take up to 7-8 hours to develop the color onto your skin. It is a little difficult to get rid of fake tan. Normal soap would not be enough to remove fake tan. A normal fake tan fades away after 10-12 days of wearing it on the skin. A fake tan will fade away on its own due to the body's natural detoxifying process. In this process, dead skin cells gently fade away, and new cell formation on the skin. A fake tan will also fade away with the removal of dead skin cells. As dead skin cells are replaced and new ones are formed, the skin will go back to its natural color easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Apply Fake Tan At-Home?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSkin Preparations/Exfoliation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot investing enough time grooming their skin for a tan is the greatest mistake people make. To extract dead skin cells, begin by exfoliating so that the tan can blend and be more uniformly absorbed. You need your skin to be ready if you want your self-tanning to last longer. If the skin is not exfoliated properly then self-tan will fade away on its own. To maintain an even basis, you need to buff away all proof of your previous tan so that your current tan goes on smoothly and looks perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWaxing/ Moisturizer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eShave or wax any excess hair at least 24 hours in advance. Any open pores presence can lead to a patchy and uneven finish. Another key reason for pre-tan shaving is that you are at risk of shaving off your tan if you do so afterward since the blades tend to suck off any dead skin cells as well as hair. You should keep skin moisturized and nourished for even spread of tan. Dry skin is the most common source of patchy tan, so it's important to moisturize yourself before self-tan. However, moisturize at least 24 hours before applying the desired tanning lotion, since the moisturizer serves as a buffer, stopping the tanning formula from touching the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApplication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen applying your chosen self-tanner, work from the feet up to maintain even coverage in an upward circular motion.

Not only that, but combination skin people also have dry patches around their nostrils, cheeks, and jawline areas. his effective facial technique serves multiple purposes.

The idea is to not apply the same mask all over your face, but different masks dealing with in different areas. This will help provide nutrients and better nourishment to the face.

Multi-masking is where several face masks are used on the skin at one time simultaneously to fight various skin issues.

Unless you’ve got the budget of a Hadid or a Kardashian, it’s unlikely you can buy into every fashion trend. Thankfully, trends are like boomerangs that eventually come back around. You’ll often find that there are already pieces in your wardrobe that are back in vogue. Shopping your closet helps you save the extra pennies to put towards a splurge purchase, like designer sneakers and a weekend getaway. We’re rounding up four fashion trends for 2021 that you \u003cem\u003eprobably \u003c/em\u003ealready have in your closet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStatement Belt\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe all remember when the Gucci Marmont belt was the \u003cem\u003eit \u003c/em\u003eaccessory to have. Every fashion brand from Zara to Topshop released their own take on the silhouette, making it likely that you have a statement belt somewhere in your closet. It’s all about the statement buckle, whether you like to go oversized with a Valentino style or a tad more minimalistic. With 2021 trends pointing towards oversized silhouettes and relaxed fits, a statement belt can help you cinch in your waist for days when you want to accentuate your curves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Bralette \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e2020 was the year of loungewear. With most of us working from home and spending more time indoors, we all reverted to wearing out comfy clothes all day long. You might have chosen to swap your wired bra out for a soft cotton bralette. For the 2021 look, wear your bralette as a crop top under a cardigan or blazer for an athleisure-inspired look. Focus on neutral colours like black, grey, and white to help your bralette blend in with your look. This trend is one that allows you to look stylish without compromising on comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBold Colours \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the grey year that was 2020, it’s no surprise that we’re all looking for a rainbow after the storm. Dig into the back of your closet and find the boldest colours you can. Whether it’s pastel pink or mint green, bring some life back to your clothing. 2021 trends are pointing to head-to-toe outfits, mixing and matching bright colours together. If you want a more elevated look, keep your outfit to one monochrome colour and mix different tones of the same shade to add depth to your look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eVoluminous Sleeves\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdd a touch of \u003cem\u003edrama \u003c/em\u003eto your look with voluminous sleeves. Before the pandemic, we were all putting together closets of glamourous outfits, whether it was pearl-embroidered headbands or velvet dresses. 2021 trends are looking to the past for inspiration, with the 80s being seen everywhere you look. A puff sleeve will add an elegant touch to any outfit, including your favourite pair of go-to jeans. Whether you’re seeing your friends in person or over a Zoom call, your voluminous sleeves are sure to make a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhich 2021 trend are you rediscovering from the back of your closet?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

This style is easier to create than you might expected, and it’s a versatile way of styling your hair. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext time you’re thinking of wearing a ponytail, give the cool space buns a try. We’re rounding up a few of our favourite ways to wear this trend to give you inspiration for how you can jump on the bandwagon as well.

All you need is a hair brush, elastics, bobby pins, and a hairspray to keep it all together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep 1: Start by brushing your hair to make sure its knot-free and split your hair into two sections with a middle parting. You want to try and make your parting as straight as possible to create two even space buns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep 2: Make each section into a ponytail, sitting at the back of the crown of your head. You want to avoid creating any bumps in your hair. You can adjust your ponytail until it’s in the place where you want your space buns to sit. Try to create a symmetrical look by having your ponytails an equal distance from your parting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep 3: Wrap your hair around the base of the ponytail. Hold the bun in place and secure it with the bobby pins. If you want to create a sleek look, it’s best to use a colour that matches your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep 4: Finish off your look with hairspray!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Messy Space Buns\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour space buns don’t have to be sitting to perfection.

Thanks to TikTok, Generation Z are discovering the era and its trends for the first time, inspiring designers to look at the decade for their design inspiration. Stirrup leggings became an 80s trend as they help elongate the leg thanks to their under-sole straps, which also keep your ankles warm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese trousers made a brief reappearance in 2016 after they appeared in the autumn/winter Balenciaga collection, causing a resurgence of the style in streetwear fashion.

The ankle detailing makes it different, turning the classic leggings from a casual loungewear piece to an elevated must-have. One celebrity who has always been a fan of the style is a trendsetter herself, Victoria Beckham.

As after all, more of them are coming from interesting and unexpected places like TikTok and Netflix shows.

It’s also helping them create a more efficient manufacturing process by reducing shipping costs and lowering transit times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the clothes are being assembled, AI systems are being used to help spot any defects in the fabrics and to make sure there isn’t any discolouration in the fabric, so that it’s as close as possible to the original design.

In other cases, you’ll be speaking to a bot who is programmed to answer specific questions and help you with the order process. Artificial intelligence is also helping brands understand how we shop and what drives us to making certain purchase. You can even have a chatbot help you figure what shoes you should buy to go with a specific dress. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome shopping apps are now allowing you to upload photos or screenshots of outfits or specific pieces that you’re looking to buy. The image recognition system will be able to find you suitable products that look similar to the items you’ve chosen.

The name simply refers to the year 2000, focusing on the trends of the early 2000s up until 2010. Why are the trends back so soon? Usually, most fashion trends work on a twenty-year cycle as one generation grows up and sees the clothing style of the previous one.

With films like Legally Blonde and Means Girl, came a popularisation of the colour pink. While it’s always been a favourite shade for women, its popularity reached new heights during the 2000s. If you want to create a y2k wardrobe, you need to make sure you have at least one pink outfit you can wear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not a fan of pink, you can stand out from the crowd in a purple outfit, with Daphne from the Scooby Movies are your style muse.

While the trend is having a resurgence thanks to the pandemic, it is a must-have for anyone who wants to channel the Y2K look. Focus on adding vibrant colours to your tracksuit collection – and if it has crystals, all the better! For a true Y2K look, you can pair your velour tracksuit with flip-flops, a white t-shirt, and a fresh spray tan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Logo T-Shirt\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe all own a graphic shirt with a logo somewhere in our closet. During the 2000s, people were obsessed with wearing designer labels, and making sure everyone knew exactly who they were wearing. The J’Adore Dior t-shirt is a classic example, appearing in both Sex and the City and several classic films from the era. While you don’t need to go to the heights of Dior, you want a logo t-shirt with a brand that matches your aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDenim Overalls\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you need Y2K outfit inspiration, the film ‘Uptown Girls’ is your one-stop-shop. Britney Murphy’s character wears a pair of patched-embossed denim overalls throughout the film that scream the early 2000s. Find a vintage pair that you like an iron on some patches of your favourite bands, logos, or things that make you smile. Add a pastel vest-top underneath and a pair of wedged heels to finish off your look. Don’t forget to add a curl to your hair and throw on a hobo bag to carry your essentials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are your favourite early 2000s trends?

All it took was a few TikTok videos for us all to start tie dying our clothes as a new hobby. Tie dye has come back as a trend during lockdown, specifically with loungewear. As we’re all working from home, comfort has become the defining factor for trends. A two-piece tie dye track suit or loungewear set gives you comfort without compromising on style. We’re going to round up everything you need to know about the tie dye trend and how you can jump on the bandwagon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are over 6 million posts on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tiedye/?hl=en\"\u003e#tiedye\u003c/a\u003e on Instagram, showing you the world of possibilities and different colour combinations, you can create. While we usually associate tie dye with the summer months, the right colour choice can make it wearable all year long. The tie dye trend last had its big hurrah during the 90s, making it no surprise that it’s came back now, while everything from the era is having a major compact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of the appeal with the tie dye trend is that its an accessible way to replicate your favourite’s celebrity’s style. It’s not like a thousand-euro handbag or an expensive gold bracelet, it’s something you can easily find an affordable version of. During the early months of lockdown, our social media feeds were full of photos of celebrities like Hailey Bieber and Jennifer Lopez rocking the trend at home while sheltering in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe internet is full of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBadLUHLe6E\"\u003eDIY tutorials\u003c/a\u003e teaching you how to make your own tie dye clothes, using t-shirts and other garments that you no longer love. While half of the population was making banana bread and sourdough, the other half was tie dying their old clothes. Sites like Etsy and Depop have been flooded with entrepreneurs jumping on the trend and selling their own at-home tie dye pieces, many of them made using vintage pieces from the 90s. You can find everything from Nike sweatshirts to socks and hoodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot everyone will want to make a DIY tie dye tracksuit, there is no shortage of options in the mainstream.

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eThe tonal styling has been one of the biggest trends in recent seasons, with no sign of slowing down. While colour blocking was the ‘it’ trend of the 2010s, tonal dress is the breakout style for this decade. Dressing from head-to-toe in one tonal shade is an art form. It’s a way of making any outfit look instantly chic and it’s a styling tip that you can use any time of the year. It’s a bold statement, especially if you decide to go with a vibrant colour like red or fuchsia pink. The tonal dress is effortless glamour and sophistication, making even your gym gear look more elevated.

This error can leave your outfit looking flat and lifeless. You want to have at least two different textures incorporated in your look. The easiest way of achieving this is by throwing on a contrasting wool coat or choosing a textured piece as your main garment. This Paris Fashion Week look incorporates both silk and wool, with the jacket adding depth to the look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Overcomplicate It\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJumping on the tonal trend doesn’t mean that you have to wear a half a dozen different pieces. Keep it simple and focus on two or three pieces. A matching tonal pantsuit or a dress with shoes in the same colour family are easy ways to experiment with this trend without overcomplicating it. There are no firm rules with tonal dressing. As long as your pieces are within the same colour family and compliment each other, you’re all set to go! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAccessories Can Contrast\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough your clothes should be the same colour, there is no reason why your accessories have to be as well. You can add a pop of extra colour to your look, or tone down the boldness of your outfit, with a different colour of accessory. Make sure it’s a colour that compliments your main tonal choice and that it doesn’t distract the eye too much from the streamline look of your outfit. Avoid adding two bold colours together as they can overpower each other. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMinimalistic Footwear\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWearing a tonal outfit is a statement in itself, so you don’t want to get caught up on your shoes. It’s always best to go with a minimalistic style that’s a shade or two on either side of your main colour. Sling-back heels, like the style worn here by Eva Chen, are the perfect sleek choice of footwear. You can also use your shoes as a way of adding different textures, like how these suede shoes contrast with the leather trousers. You want to create a seamless look from head to toe that blends the tones together to create a uniform outfit.\u003c/p\u003e",

Vintage fashion isn’t all modest, and it’s a wide umbrella term that encompasses every decade prior to the early 2000s. You might consider the 60s to be your idea of vintage fashion, while your best friend might look at the 90s with the same viewpoint.

Before you focus on how to wear vintage clothing, you want to figure out what it means for you. Go in search of style inspiration on sites like Pinterest and create a vision board so you can see what era you’re drawn to most. This step will help you narrow down your searches while shopping for vintage clothing. Having reference photos can also make it easier for you to put together outfits as you start acquiring vintage pieces. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShop Second Hand\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring 2020, the online second-hand market saw an exceptional growth of \u003ca href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/the-year-in-secondhand-vintage-upcycling-sustainable-fashion\"\u003e27%,\u003c/a\u003e as we all turned to apps like Depop and Etsy to get our clothing while the shops were shut.

The more research that you do, the easier it’ll be to find the pieces you want. You should try to find out what the popular brands were on that era, as this can help you search for specific pieces that might not be listed accurately. While sites like Depop have sellers who specialise in vintage clothing, sometimes the real diamonds in the rough come from casual sellers who aren’t sure what it is they’re selling. You’ll want to figure out the common searches to check to find the clothing that you ant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMake Any Repairs ASAP\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eVintage clothing will often show signs of wear and tear, especially if you’re looking at older pre-90s clothing. It’s a good idea to learn some basic sewing skills so you can replace any missing buttons or sew up any small holes in your garments. You want to make any repairs as soon as you spot them to prevent any further damage to your vintage clothing. If you’re not a master with a needle, it’s worth looking for a seamstress who can help you repair your clothing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might also decide to have some of pieces tailored to fit you.

We’re rounding up the 5 biggest colour trends for 2021 that you’ll want to add to your wardrobe ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBubblegum Pink\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eElle Woods called; she wants her signature colour back. Pink is a colour that always makes a comeback in spring. The bubblegum shade is a bold choice that’s been spurred on by the resurgence of early 2000s trends. It is a transition colour between a pastel and a neon, making it easy to style and versatile for your wardrobe. Don’t feel like you have to go off the deep end with a head-to-toe pink tonal outfit. You can start small and incorporate the colour into your wardrobe with a bag or a peplum top.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYellow\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want a pastel colour that isn’t overwhelming, now is your time. Mellow yellow is one of the biggest colour trends for 2021, giving you a more muted down than sunshine yellow to make it the perfect alternative to white. Incorporate this shade into your closet for spring and summer to bright a little sun with you wherever you go. We think this colour would look perfect in a smock dress or a pair of sneakers if you want to make a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTangerine Orange\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet in your daily dose of vitamin C with a tangerine orange outfit. The key to pulling off this trend is to focus on this deeper shade, as opposed to the coral oranges you start to see around spring and summer time. Various shades of vibrant orange have been appearing every few seasons, particularly for the warmer months. It’s the perfect alternatives to pastels and neon shades like yellow. You can wear this colour from head to toe or incorporate it with more muted shades like black.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e Magenta\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a fan of pink, 2021 is the year for you. Magenta pink is a deeper shade than bubblegum pink and sits closer to purple than it does to a pastel pink. You can also find some shades that have a red undertone to them. Magneta pink works all year round, especially in autumn and winter as an alternative to lighter shades. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAcid Green\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we see this shade of green, we instantly think of Billie Eilish. This acid green is a little more muted than what the singer typically wears, but she’s a driving force behind this trend. This colour shits between green and yellow, as a low-key neon shade that is wearable for everyday.

Changing up your hair style can be as much a statement of your personality and development as it is about fashion. In 2020, many of us had to do our hair from home and master the art of the box-dye and even cutting our own fringe. We hope that this year we get to return to the salons for a professional cut. With this in mind, we’re rounding up the 5 biggest haircut trends that you’ll want to consider trying in 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCurly Lob \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lop is slightly longer than your traditional bob, coming down well below the chin and usually touching the shoulders. The focus of this trend is as much on the texture of the hair as the length. You want to create bouncy curls, with the ringlet style being perfect for this shorter length of hair. You can add a set of curtain bangs or wear your hair pulled back like Bella Hadid did when she was rocking this look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Blunt Bob\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the curly lob isn’t for you, try the structured bob. This style requires a little more maintenance than the previous one, but it’s the perfect choice for a professional look. The blunt bob is a favourite of Khloe Kardashian, who changes her hair out as often as most people change their shoes. You can replicate this trend with a middle parting and by cutting your hair until it sits between your chin and shoulder blades. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLong Layers + Unicorn Shades\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s never been easier to try a new hair colour without the fear of commitment. Virtually every haircare brand has come out with their own wash-out colour formulas, meaning you can test drive a colour before making the permanent switch.

The longer, layered haircut complements a unicorn shade perfectly and gives it the real estate to stand out and make a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e70s Bangs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re an avid follower of fashion and beauty trends, you’re likely seeing the 70s aesthetic everywhere, with hairstyles being no exception. The secret to a 70s haircut is all in the bangs. Ask your hairstylist to focus on recreating the classic curtain bangs, which should sweep to both sides of your face and frame your features. This haircut is an easy way to change up your look and give your appearance a vintage feel. You can level up these bangs by adding volume and texture for a Farrah Fawcett inspired look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Pixie\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pixie haircut was everywhere in the mid-2000s and is back with a bang.

If the current growth level continues, this will hit \u003ca href=\"https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Summary-of-Findings_Updated_1-12-17.pdf\"\u003e26%\u003c/a\u003e in the next 30 years.

One cotton t-shirt requires 700 gallons of water, about the amount the water an adult drinks every three and a half years. The jeans you’re probably wearing take 2,000 gallons to make each pair. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://truecostmovie.com/learn-more/environmental-impact/\"\u003eCotton farming\u003c/a\u003e in particular is harming our planet, particularly due to its excessive use of water and waste products including chemicals.

At that rate, you could fill the Sydney Harbour every year. Three-fifths of clothing ends up in landfill within a year of us purchasing it. It shows an easy way of us to become more sustainable, by making sure we get our money’s worth out of clothing and wearing it more than a handful of times.

In fact, all it takes is a few small steps. Most fashion garments are difficult to recycle, with less than 15% of people donating their clothing or choosing to try to recycle it. Millennials and Generation Z are leading the way to make the industry more sustainable. 60% of the Millennial demographic have said they are trying to shop more sustainably.

After a year of living in our loungewear, it’s no surprise that we’re not in a hurry to return to the bodycon dresses and tight skinny jeans of the past.

It’s been a menswear staple for years, reappearing a streetwear essential several years ago. Now the accessory has been made chic by the band of supermodels that dictate every trend. This sleeveless outer layer is easy to style and you can throw it over anything from your gym gear to an oversized college sweater. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever the gilet isn’t entirely new on the womenswear scene. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne area where the gilet has always been a staple is in classic British fashion, where it is beloved for its equestrian heritage.

It’s a functional outer-layer piece that you can throw on before heading out the door. The gilet is the perfect transitional piece between seasons when you want a little extra warmth without committing to wearing a coat or jacket. Throw one into your gym bag or backpack to wear on your commute home to keep you cosy and comfortable. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe girl gilet is now the ultimate must-have in loungewear and casual street-style. You can easily incorporate one into your closet to create your own off-duty supermodel look.

If you’re not afraid to make a statement, take a leaf out of Hailey Bieber’s book and choose a bold colour like florescent green.

Gen Z babies were born from 1997-2012, meaning they were too young to experience the early 2000s trends. There are over 1.3 billion videos (yep, billion!) on \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/y2k\"\u003ethe #y2k\u003c/a\u003e on TikTok.

You can think Harry Styles for kicking it off. TikTokers are wearing them with everything from baggy t-shirts to bralettes. Argyle is the most popular print for this top, which is part of the Y2K trend, as well as being inspired by the late 70s and early 80s. These sweater vests are unisex, and you might find a better fit and look from the menswear section!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCorset Tops\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTikTok fell in love with Bridgerton series on Netflix, with the app quickly filling with videos of girls recreating the classic corset look. Corsets have gone beyond being lingerie to being a top in their own right. You can style them over a dress for a more modest look or wear them on their own with jeans for an evening appropriate look. You can channel your inner Scarlett O’Hara with a waist cinching corset. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSustainable Fashion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne trend that’s come from TikTok is more impactful than the rest. Most of the videos you’ll see on the app, particularly by younger creators, focus on the dangers of fast fashion and promoting sustainable alternatives.

Millenials call them ‘yoga pants’, while the Gen Z on TikTok have renamed them to ‘flared pants’. Most of the trends from TikTok focus on comfort over aesthetic, with many users calling for an end to skinny jeans in favour of a looser fit. Flared trousers are a 70s trend, which might explain their resurgence on the app. Good news, if you’re a millennial, you can dig out your old yoga pants and call them vintage! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of TikTok fashion trends?

The online purchasing has the ability to obtain more customers than just traditional shopping. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSocial media can have a significant impact on the lifestyles of people. The comments flash across the screen. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf a livestream product fails to sell within the allotted time, it will be removed from the list. Your viewers may know when the movies that they want become available. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other ways, audience members may receive discounts for purchasing products during a particular window.

For this reason, many companies are able to strengthen their eCommerce offerings by adding livestreaming to their offers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, livestream shopping is very limited in the Americas and Europe right now. It's critical for brands to leverage eCommerce trends in China for their success in current markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany sources reported that in 2018, ecommerce revenue from China alone made up $66 billion. By the end of 2020, this amount will soar 170 billion dollars because of the business news source. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChina's Internet shops played a major role in this rapid innovation in less than 3 years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe answer is in the way Chinese social media are designed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe rise of super apps\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eSocial networks, like Taobao and Wechat, can effectively function as microblogging, messaging and online shopping platforms all in one interface. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe interconnected economy of services means that live stream shopping is simply an extension of the existing model. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike Europe, in the West, applications like Instagram and Facebook integrated marketplace experience in the previous year. But in China, the super app model has been integral to their mobile first market appeal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith super apps that double as eCommerce sites and content marketplaces, China is enabling individual and collective individuals to meet each other. Livestream shopping provides a logical and clear challenge to physical retail. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust relying on recognition of an audience isn't enough to boost views and, consequently, purchase. Brands that want to maximize their events' effectiveness will take a number of different factors into consideration. Choosing the right influencers is important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Relationship Between Commerce and Content\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, influencers are like the nucleus of livestream shops. A million followers doesn't mean that you're a good influencer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough influencer marketing has evolved over the years, micro-influencers are even more important to the industry. For this very reason. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmall influencers are being more popular compared to the large influencers. This is because the smaller channels have frequent personal interaction with their intended viewers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is essential factor for successful product testimonials on livestream shopping. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRight Influencers Matter\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAs influencers take a cut of each item sold, choosing those influential personalities to pay is even more necessary in shoppings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudies show that customers rely on their friends and families when it comes to buying purchases. It is important for brands to work with influencers who have the connections and the following with their audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMicro-influencers fulfill both of these criteria. Their followers are small in number and tend to have more practical and targeted inputs and ideas for their audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe greater degree of intimacy that defines the relationship means that their blog can have more followers for their channels. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHard Work and Opportunities\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eWhile the best livestreamers promise high audiences, to get an audience, an event has to be excellent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe more popular content is, the more popular the people who make the content are. In order to sustain a large following on social media platforms, one should mix up quality content with sponsorships. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is no different than shopping at brick and mortar stores. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlanning a live event is very tedious work, with influencers searching for products they will feature, creating authentic buzz for the event with their followers, and even reaching out to followers they think will be interested in certain items. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese sorts of thing are done to keep the audience hooked on. This is what makes the commercial aspect of TEDx Live. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe behind the scenes aspect may be grueling and the marketplace competitive, but when all these elements come together what you are left with is a virtual event that draws thousands of consumers and dozens of these artpieces selling in mere seconds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt's a win-win-win strategy for all parties involved. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Home Shopping Differs From The Previous Retail Industry\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis way isn't brand new. Home shopping was a huge success in the 90s and early 2000s, and TV channels like QVC and Home Shopping Network become household names. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what is the difference between Stream and On-Line Shopping? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSocial media can provide valuable insight into shoppers' buying habits. And, it is less expensive to online shop from home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyone viewing stream can post comments and requests. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHarnessing Social Media\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eThis sense of community is another benefit of livestream shopping. Unlike QVC or HSN, conversations aren't limited to the moment of livestream. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHosts can communicate with their followers to increase there activities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSocial media such as Twitter is two-way street. Information flowing back and forth between influencers and their followers makes live streaming very helpful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to be a good host, you should get a feel for what they want to showcase to their followers based on personal interactions. They should not be expected to show anything that does not fit with their personal branding. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis allows the streaming of live shopping event to a level of authenticity that QVC fails to match. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most distinctive characteristic of this service is that consumers can actively participate in Facebook Live from wherever they are. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe real-time nature and ease of access makes it easier for brands to be in touch with consumers and listen to immediate feedback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRetail, unmediated\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest advantages of online shopping is the way that mobile devices allow people to shop for the products they want from the comfort of their own homes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLive video streaming is a great service for online shopping, as it allows anyone to participate in a buying event on the go, on a break, or even at home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey are not simply filling up a cart, they are joining in an experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is equally important for brands to broaden their audiences and increase their engagement with their products. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA product may be promoted in natural ways, instead of some sponsored or advertiser-pushed posts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEncouraging multicultural diversity\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eAnother example of this is makeup brand NYX.

If anything, the pandemic gave us a newfound appreciation for being able to travel and experience new cultures and environments. It has made the idea of travel more meaningful for us all.

When you’re booking your holiday, make sure you keep an eye out for these options. It’s worth paying a little extra for the peace of mind if this flexibility isn’t included in the standard package.

The convenience of online shopping meant that most people were choosing to shop from the comfort of their own homes, instead of venturing to the local high street or by going to the city. It’s a growing trend that we’ve been seeing since online shopping skyrocketed almost a decade ago. \u003cbr\u003eThe pandemic and lockdowns led to an increase in store closures. In 2020, a lot of retail stores closed indefinitely, showing that keeping business as usual is no longer a possibility. For businesses to grow and continue to strive, they have to adapt to the revolving retail business.\u003cbr\u003eHow is online shopping changing? Chatbots and smartphone applications already render online customer service more fun. You can get an instant response for almost any question you have around a product, especially from brands that have a human at the end of their chat windows. \u003cbr\u003eWe now have come to receive tailored advice and advertisements from machine learning algorithms. Have you ever glanced at a product online then seen dozens of advertisements for it in the days afterwards? That’s the algorithm starting to get to know more about you. \u003cbr\u003eAnd same-day delivery seems to be usual. If it isn’t a standard option, it’s something we’re all willingly to pay a little extra for if we need the item in a rush. Online tracking means we can see exactly where the item is and stalk it under it’s arrival.\u003cbr\u003eE-commerce has already impacted people's lives. \u0026nbsp;When shopping online, however, certain elements of the in-store atmosphere are lost. We don’t get the joy of being able to ‘window shop’ the same way that we once did. How often did you go into a store and find something that catches your eye across the room?\u003cbr\u003eShopping has long been regarded as a sensory activity. Sight, touch, vibration, odor, and taste are all important when deciding whether or not to buy items. Any time you walk through a department store, you’re always met by at least one brand ambassador handing you a perfume sample or a candle to smell. \u003cbr\u003eWhile COVID-19 will no doubt have changed this, it’s an experience we all associate with in-store shopping.\u003cbr\u003eRetailers are struggling to recreate these physical elements of shopping now that the internet has become the primary way for customers to explore products and services. But it's no news that ordering items digitally is now more convenient. How about the interaction factors? \u0026nbsp;Would buying online be as much exciting as in-store shopping? \u003cbr\u003eWhat can brands do to recreate the in-store experience online so that customers can have the best of both worlds? Customers still want to have a unique experience when they shop with you, just like they would have when they come in to visit your store.\u003cbr\u003eCue in real-time shopping. To quote Hannah Montana – it’s the best of both worlds.\u003cbr\u003eToday's businesses are seeking to bring people closer to the in-person experience by combining shopping online and live streaming. It’s a hybrid that brings you the personal touches of in-store shopping with real-time information and a two-way connection, while allowing for the convenience of online shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLive Commerce Types\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eLive streaming has the potential to transform e-commerce in much the same manner as online shopping did twenty years earlier. This fusion of video stream and shopping, called \"live commerce,\" increases interaction, reduces the distance between consumer and brand, drives sales. \u003cbr\u003eUnlike at-home shopping channels, livestreaming has the advantage of creating a more streamlined channel of communication between the host and audience. While most home shopping channels offer a mixture of live and pre-recorded shows, livestreaming is by its nature current and in real-time. Along with livestreaming, you have online marketplaces that act as a facilitator for those shows and brands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet's look at a couple of the most popular live shoppable media formats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOnline Marketplaces\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eMarketplaces allow customers to find out more about brands, ask questions and eventually buy items straight from the Livestream. The addition of livestreaming has played a vital role in increasing buyer attention. What is the explanation for this? The opportunity to buy products and services over the internet is no longer an innovation. Online marketplaces would become redundant unless additional dimensions of engagement are introduced.\u003cbr\u003eLive streaming can provide the closest experience to \"being there\" for all those customers tuning in from their home by bringing live streaming interaction. \u0026nbsp;Real-time accessibility gives the excitement of a real market, engaging in immediate action and \u0026nbsp;increase community participation. \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/\"\u003eJumble \u003c/a\u003eplatform helps brands to get closer to their customers and build this real time connection with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eInfluencer Streaming\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eCelebrities of today aren't really seen on TV. Reality shows helped put media personalities like Kim Kardashian on the map, and an increasing number of celebrities are gaining fame through social media every day. \u003cbr\u003eSome of the biggest celebrities today have gotten their starts on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Beauty brands have become billion-dollar companies after being launched by influencers or by collaborating with influencers who have millions of followers. Within a few years, ‘influencer marketing’ went from a vague concept with no rules to the main form of digital marketing for any contemporary brand.\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, new revenue opportunities have arisen. These influencers are now able to make a comfortable living – rivalling that of mainstream celebrities – by using their communities as a sales tool.\u003cbr\u003eInfluencers can use their personal brand and the power of live streaming to endorse their preferred brands in an interactive format, as they already have a large audience. Influencer streaming started on social media, but it has since expanded to e-commerce platforms like\u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/\"\u003e Jumble.\u003c/a\u003e The format has the highest user engagement among younger demographics. Tapping into the potential of livestreaming can help you grow your business and expand your customer base.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLive Shows\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere's a lot of similarity between live events and the above-mentioned categories. Even so, newsworthy events like product launches, limited-edition drops, and retail holidays like Singles Day, Black Friday lend themselves exceptionally well to shoppable live broadcasts on \u003ca href=\"https://jumble.tv/\"\u003eJumble.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can base your live shows around a specific event, whether it’s one of the holidays we’ve just mentioned, or something fun like a new product release. Live shows work the same way as influencer streaming. You can choose to facilitate it with members of your own team or tap into influencers to incorporate their audience into your marketing.\u003cbr\u003eViewers can also buy any of the items seen on the product launch via Jumble platform. \u0026nbsp;Fans now can buy directly in real-time thanks to live streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

The first application of AI in fashion is as an advisor. Customers receive fashion tips based on their height, weight, and current size via artificially intelligent digital assistants. Users are then provided detailed sizing depending on the data they submitted into the application. The precision of sizing is dependent on input from other users. On average around 30% of online purchases are returned that's why the use of AI in customer advisory is important as it allows for greater customer satisfaction and a reduction in the number of returns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor simplicity and efficiency inside shops and online shopping, AI may also be used. Retailers can keep track of the inventory and determine which retailers require which products by tracking orders, returns, and internet transactions. \u0026nbsp;Artificial intelligence could help retailers save billions annually by enhancing productivity in numerous processes and operations. \u0026nbsp;This is a big amount, so it's obvious that many companies want to integrate emerging technology like AI into their operations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow AI can boost sustainability?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fashion industry is still one of the largest polluters. It accounts for 10 % of global carbon dioxide emissions, 20% of the world's industrial wastewater, and 25% of all insecticides used in the industry. It is unrealistic to believe that this sector would be able to follow up with fast fashion by producing more and more clothes. Artificial intelligence, though, may be used to combat this problem at several levels of production, like decreasing inventory levels. \u0026nbsp;AI presents a long-term alternative to the fashion industry, minimizing operational inventory volumes by 20–50 percent while simultaneously enhancing working standards. \u0026nbsp;The implementation of Artificial Intelligence in addition to Computer Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Visual Recognition, and Data Analytics may be utilized to decrease errors in trend forecasting more specifically, decreasing the amount of clothing manufactured and then unused.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBenefits of AI for Fashion Industry\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eReinforced customer service \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntelligent chatbots and other assistive technologies have revolutionized customer service and how consumers communicate with fashion brands.

Today's retail consumers are more aware and less likely to purchase the wrong clothing item thanks to AI-enabled personalization and product description. As a consequence, fewer items are returned, and consumer loyalty increases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIn summary \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are several ways in which AI and machine learning technologies affect the global fashion industry like product personalization or better design.

They are able to give many a closer experience with a personal touch, mixing entertainment with an ordinary process. The balance between being able to have human interaction and the distance and anonymity that comes with a screen, creates a more comfortable space for many customers.

Dark Academia is a subculture that had been slowly building on platforms like Tumblr and Pinterest before being given a new lease on life through TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDark Academia is an elevated fashion trend that focuses on classic silhouettes from the 1930s through to the 1950s. Imagine the sort of outfits students would have wore to prestigious universities during this era. The clothing is almost entirely neutral, with a focus on materials like wool. The TikTokers in this subculture will be found sipping on their black coffee with a leather-bound book, while wearing a turtleneck and loafers. Thrifting plays a major role in this subculture, promoting the sustainable fashion practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCottagecore\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Dark Academia is found in the corridors of a library at midnight, then cottagecore is their distant cousin. This is another subculture that started on social media platforms like Reddit and Tumblr. As the name suggests, cottagecore is focused on the ideal rural lifestyle. It’s a romanticisation of nature with a focus on floral arrangements, reconnecting with the outdoor world, and wearing dresses that look as though they belong in a children’s books.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cottagecore fashion trends has seen a spike in searches for brands like Laura Ashley and Liberty London as thousands of TikTok users hunt down the perfect floral dress to show off to their flowers. This subculture also focuses on natural makeup or wearing no makeup at all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eE-Girls\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the opposite end of Cottagecore, we have the E-Girl subculture. This aesthetic is a blend of scene, punk, and goth. Imagine the sort of clothing you would have seen people wearing to a Paramore concert in the early 2000s. It’s all about fishnets and miniskirts with vintage band tees and hair that has more than one colour in it. You can even find DIY videos online teaching you how to become part of this subculture. This trend has even made its way into the world of luxury fashion, as Celine took inspiration from the e-boy equivalent as part of their menswear collection for spring 2021. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of these subcultures?

You can make this trend wearable for everyday by choosing a traditional cut-out below the neckline.

The print is synonymous with the early 2000s and the Clueless film, but it’s also the perfect way to add a little vintage to your outfit. If you want to elevate your look, stick to classic checked prints in hues of red and green. The trend is everywhere this spring and in every colour palette. If you want to save yourself a penny or two, pick a checked skirt up from your local vintage store for an authentic look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFeather Trims\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis London Fashion Week was all about looking forward to the days when we can finally party again. At lockdown, we’re all going to be channeling the roaring 20s of the Gatsby era. Feather trims were one of the big trends of LFW and they’re heading straight to our closet. Although we often associate feather trims with extravagant ballgowns and tailoring, you can add them into your closet with a simple t-shirt or jacket. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTailored Suits\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a year of wearing loungewear, we’re all ready to bring our suits out from the back of the closet. Tailored suits were one of our favourite LFW trends and the perfect way to show off your quarantine glow-up. You don’t have to run out the door and invest in a custom suit. Instead, you can pull together a few of your favourite pieces to create the illusion of a tailored suit. Start with a tweed jacket and fitted trousers to create your suit, adding in your favourite colours of the season with your accessory choices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIcy Blue\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spring, we’ll be filling our wardrobe with Princess Elsa blue, the icy shade that complements every skin tone.

This experience is what sets livestreaming apart from normal e-commerce shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStronger marketing impact\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eBy going live, you will broaden and expand awareness of your brand.

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eToday, we’re sharing tips and tricks on how you can take your brand to the next level by livestreaming. The opportunities you get with livestreaming allow you to create a unique experience for your audience. As a brand, you always want to be getting ahead of the competition and putting your best foot forward. Livestreaming is the future of online advertising. It’s the perfect time to get involved and to learn the secrets behind hosting a successful livestream. By getting on the bandwagon early, you can master your craft and be ready for when livestream becomes the number one way of selling products online.\u003cbr\u003eThe one thing that holds brands back from livestreaming is that they don’t know how to hold their audience’s attention. It’s the biggest mistake that brands make when they start livestreaming. We all have a short attention span thanks to social media. We’re used to consuming bite-size versions of clips and information that only take a few minutes of our time. Livestreams usually last anywhere from thirty minutes to over an hour, meaning you’ve got to hold your audience’s attention for as long as a Netflix show.\u003cbr\u003eThanks to Jumble, it’s never been easier to keep your audience engaged with your livestream and interested in your product. After all the work you put into your livestream, you want to make sure your audience sticks around for as long as possible.\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to livestreaming, you want to put yourself in the audience’s shoes. Imagine if you were aimlessly scrolling through a website, adding items to your basket. You get distracted by something else and forget all about your online cart. Part of the reason why customers abandon their cart online is that they aren’t sure about the products. While online shopping has its benefits, it comes with some unique limitations. You can’t see the products in action. We’ve all been disappointed by something we bought online and ended up returning.\u003cbr\u003eTo reduce the risk of buyer’s remorse, you turn to buying more heard-about clothes, devices - judging by the fact your friend or that celebrity bought it, it has to be trustworthy. But do you like it because others have it, or you because it is less of a risk?\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty of livestreaming is that it gives your products a unique insight into the product. It recreates the in-store experience and allows the audience to see the product in detail. The host takes on the role of a sales assistant, showing off the product to your audience. They can answer any questions the audience has, as well as sharing insider information, such as tips and tricks. If you’ve ever tried buying a makeup product online, you know how helpful it would be if you had someone showing you the product before you make your purchase.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re looking to sell your products online and build brand awareness, livestreaming is the best way to do it. During the 2010s, YouTube was the main online platform for selling products, with influencers incorporating items into their videos that would go on to become instant best-sellers. For the 2020s, livestreaming is king. It gives your audience the ability to see products in real-time from a trustworthy source that feels more like a friend than someone trying to sell a product.\u003cbr\u003eWe’re sharing\u003cstrong\u003e five fun livestream ideas\u003c/strong\u003e to get you started:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShow What Makes the Product Unique\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf your brand is selling clothes, it is an incredible opportunity to show the quality, the stitching and how it fits on different sizes. You can show the audience why your product is worth the price tag. We’ve all ordered a garment online and then have it arrive in a virtually unwearable condition. With a livestream, you can show the clothes in action and on another human being. Photos can be deceiving, and customers are becoming smarter and more aware of how brands often photoshop and edit their clothing photos to make them appear nicer. Livestreaming allows you to show the actual product and gain your audience’s trust.\u003cbr\u003eThere’s another person you can invite into your livestream. A professional stylist is a must-have for a fashion livestream as they can be another source of trustworthy information for your audience. The stylist can show different looks like complement almost every aesthetic within your brand. They can present your clothing in a new and exciting way. Including with other products that you might not have thought would work together.\u003cbr\u003eBy seeing the clothes on a real person from different angles, your audience can see themselves in the clothes. A photo is a 2d image that only shows a limited portion of your item. With a livestream, your host or stylist can jump around in front of the camera and show how the product moves in real life. Your audience is more likely to buy clothing when they see it on someone else. Let your viewers feel special by giving them a discount if they order multiple products or if their order is worth a certain value.\u003cbr\u003eIf you’re selling a beauty or self-care product, the same rules apply. While you can see what clothing looks like online, all you see with a makeup product is the packaging. Customers are aware that product pictures are not always accurate, and they want to know what the makeup looks like a ‘normal’ person and not a model. \u003cbr\u003eA makeup tutorial allows the audience to enjoy the creative process and really see how the makeup sits on the skin. You can really embrace the beauty in diversity, showing the ethical support your brand stands for. It’s also an opportunity to explain the ingredients inside your products and what makes them special. If you have a unique formula, your livestream is the perfect opportunity to explore it in more detail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShow the Product in Action\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you are advertising products that are outside use, like vehicles, skis, bicycles or skateboards, you can save someone the time for research process and go straight to showing it in action. You can take the viewer around on a virtual trip, something many of us around the world are limited to. \u003cbr\u003eIt can feel like a ‘day in the life’ video, where a youtuber is casually entertaining themselves by using your product, sharing his experience of it and showing off its value. You can set-up a livestream video anywhere that you can internet connection. As long as you have Wi-Fi or 4G, you could take your adventure bike product to a mountain and show an influencer using it on a track. You want to find a balance between keeping your livestream casual, with the influencer talking to the camera, along with showing the item in action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCollaborate with Other Brands\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a brand that offers kitchen utilities, decorations, or food related products, you can collaborate with restaurant/cafe owners. You can recreate the feel of a cooking show or use your tools to make a meal that in the kitchen of a local restaurant or café. The restaurant can promote your event, allowing you to take advantage of their audience and give you some free advertising.\u003cbr\u003eIt’s beneficial for both you and your collaborating brand as you can offer their audience a behind-the-scenes look of their restaurant. You can even use your products to create a signature dish from the restaurant.\u003cbr\u003eIt will be a fun way to sell recipe books, handy and quality kitchen supplies and other decorations while entertaining your audience and giving them an evening of entertainment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCreate a Memorable Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eEmotional memory is the strongest tool we have as humans. You can use that to your advantage by offering a memorable experience. For example, selling furniture, a lot of it has to be transported in pieces and built on location. Why not take it to a crazy beautiful location like a top of a hill with a view?\u003cbr\u003eYou can take your audience on a journey with you. You can bring the furniture to the location and built-it on site. Your influencer and host can show your audience how to build the item. The audience gets to experience the fun challenge of putting furniture together. Every time they see your brand name or product, they’ll be transported back to your livestream and feel a connection to the item.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eShare Your Process\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr\u003eIf you sell hand-made products or create them in a lab, you want to use your livestream to share your process through behind-the-scenes content. You don’t need to share all the secrets behind your brand, but instead you can give a general overview of the process. You can set-up your livestream with a selfie stick. and walk around your space. You can show everything from the packaging that you use to some of your employees putting the product together.\u003cbr\u003eEvery live stream should have its own unique story and purpose.

Human desires are a source of great pleasure and during the age of the internet, we can often be overwhelmed with the colourful spectrum of temptations screaming for our attention. Many advertisements, playing on the basic human needs of happiness, friendship and success, forget of the correlation between the value they promise and the value they bring. It has become too easy to comfort ourselves at a greater cost than the momentarily pleasure. While it is our choice to buy more than we need due to social and emotional reasons, the design of the online markets and shops is set up to catch your attention and convince you of the products’s value, with a lack of possibility to assess it for yourself. Some of the reasons of consumer exploitation include limited information of the products, the misleading advertisements we fall pray to and scarcity in the online service sector set-up. When will the rise of consumerism invite the evolution and integrity into the consumer-producer relationship? Livestream shopping is combining efficiency, value and pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile we think shopping makes us happy, what will actually make us happy is the value it will add to our life. Rash decisions often lead to regrets, but in the case of Livestream shopping, there possibility to buy fast is combined with numerous advantages to normal shopping. To avoid regrets and unnecessary buying, you want to know the value you will get for your money. Scrolling first through numerous websites, pages and accounts, your best bet is to trust the reviews or spend more time reading them. You still will not know until you try the product yourself. Now imagine the possibilities that come with Livestream shopping. The presence of a host adds a huge advantage to other forms of shopping, acting in interests of both the buyer and the seller.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirstly, the journey itself becomes more entertaining, we all love to see a more personal touch on products, let alone the process of acquiring it. The familiarity between the buyer and the host makes one more feel more safe and included in the process, you can ask questions and feel like you are there with them. The host will give you a very good idea of the product, by showing it from all angles or being put to use. This way, you can analyse and predict the functionality of a product, assess the quality of the material, its durability, experience it almost personally. You can ask about the ethics of the manufacturing process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, there is also an stronger aspect of honesty present, as the host doesn’t know what questions she will be asked, so if you have doubts over the possible future complaints, their confidence in the product can be tested very spontaneously and you could avoid buying, just for the sake of buying. Imagine in the case of make-up brands, such a saturated retail sector, wouldn’t you love to see the product being tried on, knowing there is no photoshop included? See its texture, ask about the effects of ingredients.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuality not quantity moto has never been as important as it is today. There is a need of awareness in regards to consumption, its effects on the wellbeing on a personal and global level. Our planet is in need of care and that starts with conscious personal decisions. One way we can help, is by being more careful with our choice of products, picky over the quality. Livestream shopping maximises the pleasure of the experience you get from online shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e",

Her luscious red wig had us all wanting to channel our inner Queen of the North by going copper red. After the popularity of the Queen’s Gambit, Netflix’s latest hit tv series, the trend has reached new heights. Although Anya Taylor Joy is a natural bleach blonde, the actress had a short red bob for her critically acclaimed role.

Everyone from Lizzo to Zendaya and Emma Roberts have experimented with the warm red shade. Some celebrities have used it as their signature throughout their career, like Isla Fisher who is a proud redhead and whose auburn locks has been a source of inspiration for us all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of this hair colour is that it works for any shape or length of hair.

As the colour starts to fade over time, you want to make sure to keep your hair moisturised with a hydrating mask as part of your regular haircare routine. Depending on the fragility of your hair, you want to be using a hair mask once or twice a week after washing your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you dye your hair any colour, whether you do it yourself or visit a salon, you want to change up your shampooing routine. It’s worth investing a colour-protecting shampoo to help maintain the brightness of your colour and to improve the longevity of your dye. Along with a new shampoo, you’ll want to make sure you’re conditioning your hair every time you wash it. Once you start dying your hair, you need to take extra care to maintain the condition of your hair and to prevent damage to the hair follicles that you result in breakages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eNot Sure if You Want to Commit?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn recent months, we’re seeing more haircare brands releasing wash-out hair colours.

Brands have been competing for the attention of the audience of stars like the Kardashians, soon only to realize the expansion of opportunities with the presence of mini-stars, micro-bloggers, who’s much smaller audience does not lack in support or devotion. Their support in a product has shown to bring much higher conversion rates than the celebrities, while having higher engagement rates. How does this relate to brands marketing strategy innovation and its use for Live Stream selling?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMini-stars with 50-100 thousand followers have an audience that has more trust in them than the more famous stars of social media. Instagram has been a powerful tool to create an audience for those posting their life and identity in a stylish way. It is observable that the ones who have become giants of Instagram have a less unique approach to their online presence, maybe due to their name becoming a brand in itself and using it mostly for personal gains.\u0026nbsp; The ones with a smaller audience have more transparency with their likes and experiences, thus are more authentic. This creates a deeper sense of familiarity for their followers, whose trust grows with each post. Being more relatable and viewed as more ‘common’ by their followers, those in return are more interested in what they recommend to buy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not just about making your advertisement or product be seen, it is about conveying your brand identity directly to the hearts of your audience. Less about the visual effect, the internet and TV is already full of advertisements screaming you are missing out on the best thing there is. Having the unprejudiced attention of the audience is priceless. Having someone who is viewed as a peer or a friend talk about their experience of your product is different to having someone who does it on a daily basis and the fans are already used to the concept of them making a business out of it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis goes perfectly with Livestream Shopping selling and your brand choosing the perfect host for your presentation. Targeted marketing through micro-bloggers acting as hosts will bring you a much more lively audience and you are more likely to have their attention for the whole stream. You can target the audiences more efficiently, adding to the intimacy and trust created by going live already. It will be a more unique event, bringing the audience and your brand closer through this third party that brings realness and life to the table. At better costs, you will have more engagement and conversion rates. You can switch up the hosts you choose, opening up to a whole new level of opportunities by maybe making them shorter, but more often. The viewers will want to act on those discounts and excitement spread by someone they see as a peer. Seeing a down to earth human that they relate to so much, they will almost automatically believe in your products presented. The critique will be honest, not just paid for. Thus, less resistance to skip onto the next opportunity out there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

With the rise in technological advances and the age of social media, more of us have taken to sharing our lives online with total strangers. It started simple enough with selfies of ourselves our with our friends. Over the last few years, sharing your life online has become a profitable way of ranking in millions of dollars. We’ re each creating a digital footprint, like a time capsule of our lives, becoming more open with each change in social media.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking the perfect selfie has become an art form. We all know the way to turn our head to hide a double chin or to give us Angelina Jolie worthy cheekbones. We each have a favourite filter that we automatically apply to our photos. We’re editing our selfies to within an inch of their lives. Gone are the days when you took a selfie before a big event – now we take them everywhere. Museums have even had to put a ban on selfie-taking due to the disruption they’ve caused and almost every public institution and theme park has banned the infamous selfie stick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since the magazines started to photoshop their cover models, our days of self-declared perfectionisms were ahead of us. Fast forward thirty years and you can download photoshop directly to your iPhone and do the same amount of editing as any magazine photographer to your selfie. We all know someone who looks drastically different on their Instagram feed compared to how they look in real life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we were calling them selfies, we have the MySpace pictures. These came around in the mid to late 2000s, when MySpace was at its height and we were all taking photos on the crappy cameras of our flip phones to post as our profile picture. When smartphones made their way into the mainstream in the early 2000s, we started to up our selfie game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all, the camera that is now in our smartphones is of a similar quality to professional DSLR cameras. Fast forward a few years, and the age of influencers came around in the early 2010s, when selfies became monetised. The right influencer could (\u003cem\u003eand certainly does) \u003c/em\u003echarge thousands of dollars to post a selfie of them wearing or mentioning a product by a brand.

There host will have to improvise most of the communication and just be himself like you would on a typical social media live, you can ensure it will run smoothly by taking in mind and controlling the following factors:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEquipment and setting-up\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing a phone with a good camera quality will allow you to stream directly from the streaming platform like \u003cstrong\u003eJumble. \u003c/strong\u003eYou will need to make sure it’s positioning grabs a good angle that will allow you to move around within it, or put it into a stabilizing tripod/selfie-stick. There are many you can find with a microphone and a torch light. This will give you the ability to take the audience with you around the studio, boutique or wherever you will be going, creating even more excitement for them. It is important to consider that if you go to noisier places, you will need a good microphone that filters out the noise for audio experience optimization. Streaming really requires much less hustle with equipment preparation in comparison to a typical advertisement.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe sure to check you are streaming from a place with good internet connection or service right before the live. Although the live might not stop, technical errors are annoying for the viewers. If you are going to be moving around, you need to consider this beforehand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want to consider when your target audience is most active and what sort of experience would they enjoy. If it is late at night, consider that they will be at home, and a sense of familiarity and casualness will bring a lot of comfort. You don’t want to put them asleep though, so make sure the host is ready to entertain without being overbearing.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAssistants\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe host will need someone to be on stand-by, who can pass them the products if needed, bring them water or snacks and give a hand with heftier products like furniture. You don’t want to go “out of character” by struggling with clearing the space for the presentation of the next product or your cat sitting in front of the camera. All sorts of things will happen and the host will have to adapt to them casually and make a laugh out of it, yet you don’t want these situations to steal the time slot reserved for a discount.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eProcess\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe host has to know which products will go after which, it might be a good idea to variate them by making the more exciting ones come later during a stream or in between other ones less desirable. Although it is hard to make a definite time slot because the host will have to prioritize communicating with the audience as much as possible, it is still a good idea not to spend too much time on each one and to put a little pressure on the viewers to make up their mind to buy. You will help this decision by knowing when to speed them up by offering discounts for the first ones to buy it and in an auction-like style remind them that time is running out. You will have to strategize beforehand which combinations of products will have a discount, or 2-1 offers and other variations of perks you can offer, and strategically integrate them into the sale by the order of products. You don’t want to offer all of the juiciest offers at the beginning, yet you want to excite the public from the moment they join.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe host will have to always remember that behind the screen there is a crowd of people and it is not just a recording. By always communicating in a lively manner, asking them what they want to know or making them have fun when they are responding less is a great way to keep the audience on their toes. Even if there are two hosts, whatever they are doing together be it talking or sharing advice or live reactions, they always have to make the audience feel included and noticed. Read out their reactions with their username, ask personal questions to get to a better idea of who is behind the screen. There are many ways for all parties to have fun, important is to go with the flow with the consideration of the factors we listed here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

It’s something you can wear while working from home or heading into the city for brunch with your friends. You can wear it everything from a little black dress to your favourite jeans and a t-shirt. The laid-back silhouette means the shacket is universally flattering and a staple in everyone’s closet. Whatever your style aesthetic is, you can benefit from adding the shacket to your wardrobe rotation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe shacket looks like a button-up shirt but has the functionality of an everyday jacket.

In 2020, we lived in our slippers, occasionally venturing out in a pair of white sneakers to run errands to the grocery store. Fashion trends are now focusing on comfort over aesthetics, with no one wanting the pair and discomfort of stumbling around in a pair of sky-high Louboutins. While you might think loafers remind you of your days at school, they’re the flat shoes that you’ll be wearing all of 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlat shoes are experiencing a major comeback in 2021, whether it’s the Birkenstocks or shearling slippers.

There’s a dozen different reasons why you might want to get rid of some of the clutter sitting around in your closet. After all, that’s money going to waste. We’re all becoming more aware of the dangers of fast fashion and the role we all have to play in making the industry more sustainable. It’s just as much about what we do with our clothes at the end of their life that matters as the clothes themselves. Instead of sending your clothes to landfill, you can put them for sale on one of these resale apps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDepop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDepop is everyone’s favourite fashion resale app. The app plays host to thousands of small businesses and vintage resellers who are making a small fortune by selling second-hand clothing.

If you’ve got an extensive collection of pieces to sell, you might even consider opening a second Instagram account to use as your own fashion marketplace.

This you can do on all your social media pages and your website. Having chosen a host to lead it, you want to spread a little information on them so the audience can check out their social media and get a better idea of why this will be interesting to watch - it is more than a one way commercial! You can create enticing advertisements in the theme of the future stream, as if sprinkling reminders they will remember. Not being repetitive is key, as it will just become another post they skip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChoose the right host\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet the host to announce themselves as a host of your stream, sharing why live streaming is a fun and worthwhile experience for their fans and discount scavengers. You want them to give their audience an introduction of the theme of the sales, talk about your brand universe and why they believe in it, maybe giving a sneak peak into their favourite items. You don’t want to give away all of the perks they will have while watching it -discounts and prizes, but you want the audience to know it will be there. It might be interesting to do a ‘giveaway’, by choosing 10 people who comment, follow your page and share with friends the announcement of the steaming date, who will win a product or a discount. Email everyone on the subscribers the link a few hours or a day before, not too long before so it doesn’t get lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDrop news about upcoming collection\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have a new collection or new products coming out, spike up excitement by selling it live a month or a few before they get released on the shop. Your audience wants to feel special, the possibility to have what no one else has seen yet will make them feel unique and like they have won a deal. \u0026nbsp;While awareness of live stream selling is rising, it is still not mainstream. That is why when they get something that is still not on the market, they will be not only happy with the product, but with the way they got it. This will have them sharing with all their friends, making them extremely curious. Limited edition pieces is something you can also incorporate into your production and maybe consider selling on live stream only. The deals your audience gets buying live is already an exclusive experience, but what can be more exclusive than being one of the few to manage to buy it, when it is not on the regular e-market? The process of buying on a platform like \u003cstrong\u003eJumble\u003c/strong\u003e is bullet-fast, making regular sales a second process. Imagine the hype the audience feels the second you announce this rare product - just like Supreme, yet without the checkout page processing. A matter of seconds. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDiscounts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMake sure to always change up the discounts, so after the first stream your clients will know to be on their toes for the next one. You can announce different pre-deals, like posting on your social media accounts that 5 viewers will win something. Somebody who shares the stream will have an opportunity to choose on which product they will have a discount when you go live, they will dm you their live selling platform username, you will call them out to give the perk later on. We are all attention and best-deal creatures, make sure to give your audience an opportunity to show themselves and participate not only by watching and asking questions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBe exclusive\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest puzzle piece of creation of excitement that captures the interests of your audience is exclusivity. You know how world wide everyone goes crazy on Black Friday, that one special time of the year for retailers, brands and shoppers. That is why we suggest that the same level of accessibility is kept for your live sessions. You are more likely to have the highest sales if your audience looks forward to your event, does not miss it and makes the most of it while there. How often you do it will have an effect on how many of your viewers come back for each one. Making it more often does not mean higher sales.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSchedule your livestream\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, if you choose a specific day of the week and the same time for your weekly stream, you are more likely to engrave that time slot in the memory of each one who comes across your brand. It will become habitual for your viewers to free up time and come online just to see what you will have to offer each time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

All of us will see anything we want when browsing through pages and websites and remind ourselves we'll get it later, or we'll throw it in the basket or save it on Instagram.

For years they were a fairly fringe accessory in the world of fashion. They’ve made the occasional reappearance through trends like the Peter Pan collar, but this is the first time they have become a trend in their own right. Gone are the days when collars were kept for fancy dresses. They’re now official in the mainstream of fashion and it’s time for you to jump on the bandwagon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe collars that we are seeing everywhere in fashion aren’t the dainty sort that you would put on your dog. Oh, no. The larger the collar, the better! We want collars that make a statement, that have ruffles and sequins. The sort of collars that you spot across a room and that make your outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow have collars become a trend?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIronically, you can thank Zoom for this one. During the pandemic, working from home became the norm and all the attention focused on whatever clothing you could see on the tiny zoom screen. You can add a collar over almost any outfit to make it look instantly elevated and to make it appear as you haven’t just rolled out of bed. It’s also a trend that celebrities like Harry Styles have been pushing for several seasons now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCollars are a world away from the low-cut silhouettes that we’re used to seeing from designer brands. Yet, Gucci and Miu Miu are at the frontline of the collar trend, creating pilgrim inspired collars for their ready-to-wear collections. If you’re looking for a more affordable way of buying into this trend, check out Ganni.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs This Modest Fashion?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way we could look at the collar trend is to line it up with the rise in modest dressing. Everyone has their own styling preference, and the world of blogging and social media influencers is bringing attention to the idea of modest dressing. Adding a collar to your rotating wardrobe allows you to take almost any neckline and make it more modest for a ladylike look. Do you think this trend marks the start of modest fashion entering the mainstream?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Can I Jump On The Trend?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the collar trend, you have two options. You can make a statement with a separate collar from brands like Maison Cleo that you can mix and match with pieces already in your closet. You can think of these collars like any other accessories and wear them like a necklace over your favourite t-shirt, dress, or blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe easiest way of experimenting with the trend is to buy a blouse with an exaggerated collar. This style is what you’re most likely to see other people wear as it’s more wearable than a dress, and you can style it down with jeans and a pair of sneakers. No two collars are ever the same. You can have a collar with scallop edges or an elevated look with lace.

Whether it’s shopping second hand or looking for environmentally friendly materials, we’re all taking steps to become more sustainable with our fashion choices. Is technology the key to a more sustainable fashion industry? If you’ve ever seen the film Clueless, you’ll know that the main character as an app-style program that virtually stores her closet. Now, over 25 years after the film came out, that app is about to become a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve all been guilty of filling our closets full of clothes and forgetting about half of them. Maybe you’ve gone into Zara, seen a black dress, bought it and taken it home, only to realise you have a nearly identical dress already in your closet.

The pollution comes not so much from the waste, as from the production process of insignificant necessities such as a hairbrush. While mindfulness is not only healthy for us, mindful shopping with consideration of how and what the products are made of, can really become a place to start to support a more ethical way of living. One of the ways we can start saving our world home, is by looking how we fill up our living one. Here are some ideas on how to fill your home with harmless beauty:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGreen Wash Laundry Ball\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis revolutionary replacement of laundry detergents is helping out on a financial, personal and global health level. For every ball you order from \u003cem\u003eLes Gargouilles\u003c/em\u003e, they reuse 300 grams of plastic. The little ceramic balls inside the big ball, are to raise the Ph of the water, leaving your clothes clean and odourless, their colours better preserved. It is respectful of sensitive skin and all types of cloth materials.. Washing with typical detergents, our clothes and the chemicals release plastic make up 35% of the plastic polluting the oceans. This ball leaves no chemicals in the water and is reusable for 1500 washing sessions, saving you at least 1000$ on detergents. This long term solution will help evade the wash down of pollutants into the ground, suffocating all living organisms in it and the water streams nearby, while generally keeping the clothes that come in contact with your skin cleaned in an ethical manner. The only risk with this is that the ball breaks open, however with its wonderful reviews, Les Gargouilles were well designed than its similarities on the market. It is advisable to get more than 2 for 6kg+ and 3 for 9kg+ of clothes. On the same website, they sell fragrances to add to your wash and salt for all types of stain removal. Its efficiency is equivalent to all common detergents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSelf-care products\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile everyone has surely come across at least one natural self-care product they liked, we typically stay with known chemical-full shampoos, hair and skin care creams and oils. For an ethical start, we could really start with our bathroom shelves. The problem with typical shampoos for example, is that our hair gets dependent on the chemicals in them, becoming incapable to produce them oils by themselves, staying healthy looking only once you use it, but losing its structural health and strength over a longer time period. The bio market is blooming with magical formulas, many centuries old that industry professionals are finding to be extremely multi-functional and beneficial. There is also a possibility to look into zero waste make-up brands, like La Bouche Rouge. This revolutionary vegan cosmetics brand makes refillable lipsticks and powder palettes, while offering customizable covers for both. Choose your shade, the color of the sleeve or palette, engrave your initials - you got yourself a lifelong, quality product. This just shows that quality, chic and mindfulness do mix well. Think of conversions to low-impact lifestyle, with a switch to some green products like bamboo toothbrush and hairbrush, stainless steel razors, reusable cotton wipes, bathroom paper, natural deodorant, mouthwash pills, a sea sponge. Getting the reusable alternatives will save you from rebuying the same things during the year, detrimental to your bank balance, health and environment. While you can always buy them, why not have a DIY session for hair and face masks? There are numerous ingredients like avocados, aloe vera, honey and lemon that are known to be superb for hair and skin care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKitchen\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key is reusable or natural material. You can create a really simplistic and beautiful aesthetic with some glass or wooden container jars, for all of your seeds, leftovers, spices and other ingredients. Think of wooden cutlery and how simply beautiful a set mixing wood and glass is.

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eSince the times of the global pandemic, no matter how many fulfilling hobbies and projects we have, we all fall prey to mindless internet scrolling. Be that social media, watching endless videos of cats and people doing things, we are always in a seek of new sensations and experiences. If we think how much energy we spend on all the different things the internet has to offer, the more is often more draining. However, this new trend of live streaming, has just about rounded up all of our favourite pastimes, combining into one. Here is why and how live streaming is become a part of life for millions in China, now spreading all over the world:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA combination of all current tech trends - social, commerce and influencers - livestream shopping is bringing us together with our favourite stars, giving us an opportunity to connect and feel closure to those we admire and those whose lives we follow for different reasons. Seeing our favourite fashionista who’s feel we love and whose creative approach to putting together pieces of clothing in a way we have not thought of is always a fun way to add value to our lives. Now we can see those stars in a much closer and personal setting than before. Watching them do a lifestream, there is even a double pleasure available. Don’t we all miss the days when we could take a stroll down the mall or our favourite shopping street with our friends, stopping for a snack and a coffee, thinking purely on how we want and what we need? Or even better- the walk back home with hands full and tired from the bag strings, thinking of all the ways we could style them, where and when we will take them out. Now we get the possibility to have that experience, but instead the tiresome trip to the mall and back home is replaced with being overwhelmed with opportunities to win discounts and prize products, all proposed by our mini-role models.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLife stream shopping is giving us an opportunity to feel in-store, but with a cosy feel. We can stay in the comfort of our home, while watching the girl we have been following for years for her eye makeup looks, talk in our favourite boutique with a professional from the industry. Saving ourselves the embarrassment of asking too many questions (hello social anxiety!), it is for once really nice to be stuck behind a screen, and not so isolating after all. We can ask whatever questions in mind, probably doing it on behalf of others watching and although a small thing, but something like being called out by that girl you follow can really render a day sweeter. Besides, things most would not think to ask when they are checking out a product or stuck in a hot changing room with those mirrors that triple all your insecurities (common stores, not cool marketing investment), like brand philosophies on product manufacturing. Being online we can really use the opportunity to weigh out our interest in the product, part of the product also includes how it has been made. Do not fear to ask the host about how close the approach of the brand they are representing is to conscious fashion ethics. Raise and spread awareness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeeing the host present the brand and not a brand employee creates an element of honesty that is very valuable in the internet world of advertisements screaming for your attention and giving you an exaggerated and filtered introduction of the product. Seeing a personality we relate to more and having the possibility to engage, means the host will have to improvise and give authentic responses. After all, they choose the products they showast for a reason that they truly find them unique, otherwise it would show when they are trying it out if they don’t appreciate its quality. Trying to sell it desperately will definitely only push us off the show and they know that. That is why Live stream shopping channels are really a place to find some gems, even better- with discounts.

		"post-body": "\u003cp\u003eLike every other aspect of our life, it looks like our makeup bags are about to get a minimalist makeover. With the focus of the industry shifting onto natural beauty, multi-purpose products are gaining in popularity with both beauty influencers and editors alike. There’s no doubt that the pandemic has also played a role in their sudden popularity. Less of us are wearing a full face of makeup (\u003cem\u003eif any makeup!) \u003c/em\u003eso we’re streamline our routine down to as few products as possible. More people want a quick and easy way of applying makeup, and the industry is responding with all-in-one beauty products. Are they worth the type?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnly a few years ago, the internet was full of beauty influencers trying to do a “\u003cem\u003efive-minute makeup” \u003c/em\u003etrend. It seems like this is about to become the future of makeup. Brands like Fenty are already leading the pack with multi-purpose products. Fenty’s Match Stix launched before the pandemic and is a highlighter, concealer, and contouring product all-in-one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA two-in-one product that always jumps to mind is the cream brush and lip duo. This all-in-one product has been around for years and almost every brand has a variant of it. Glossier is a go-to choice for people who like natural beauty and are a fan of the convenience of all-in-one beauty products. Their infamous ‘Cloud Paint’ blush can be used on your cheeks (\u003cem\u003eas intended) \u003c/em\u003eor on your lips to give a natural looking tint. It’s this style of product that you can expect to see more of in the future.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother brand that is promoting the idea of minimalistic makeup and all-in-one products is \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/merit/?utm_source=ig_embed\"\u003eMerit,\u003c/a\u003e a vegan and clean beauty brand. Their tag line is “\u003cem\u003ewell-edited essentials that have earned a place on your vanity”. \u003c/em\u003eMerit’s Instagram feed is full of advice on how to create a five-minute morning routine. The purpose of brands like Merit is to speed up your makeup routine and to make it feel less like a chore and more like a self-care routine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn aspect of these all-in-one products that is often overlooked is their sustainability. We could all confess to owning a few too many makeup products. After all, do you really need fifteen different shades of blush? The all-in-one beauty product trend promotes the idea of having a smaller makeup bag with a core group of products that have more than one purpose. Not only can these products save you money, they can cut down on waste.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing to keep in mind is that all-in-one products won’t suddenly take control of our makeup routine. Yes, they’ll play a role in making it more streamlined but just consider how many different products you have in your makeup bag. The products that you use on your eyes are usually not going suitable for your lips. In the future, we think these all-in-one beauty products will sit alongside your everyday makeup routine as a way of saving you a little extra time in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you think of all-in-one beauty products? Will you be streamlining your makeup bag?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Companies having crises that some have been brought down by completely, others have had to survive and adapt. Then there have been other sectors, tech trends and perks, like education, e-commerce and social that have been blooming ever since. The impact on the fashion industry is a big one and it goes in both ways. Having a huge hold on the global economy and being a large job provider, it is interesting to explore the different sides to it that are being forced to step up, considering the nearly global inaccessibility to boutique shopping. Here we will be exploring the effects the pandemic had on the industry and those inter-connected with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is obvious that with all the preoccupations that have arisen amongst the clients, buying new goods and following the latest trends has moved way down on the list of priorities, after health, work and basic survival for many. The response to the pandemic as measures of inclosure amongst the world have gotten many to stop with their lives and rethink their consumer habits, leading many to start buying only the necessary or highly desired. This decline in shopping has put the brands in the position to have to rethink their selling strategies, stock and collections organisation, and do it fast. Amongst the problems of the build up of unsold stock, the brands had to react to sudden and only-will-get-worse financial crises. Considering there will be a declining demand for products, brands had to cancel orders of huge quantities, leaving the retailers who have already paid for the materials and in many cases had the products already made, empty handed. Thousands of Bangladesh factories have closed, leaving 1.2 million of workers without a last full salary. 2020 events have sparked many movements to protect the works and the impact by the industry, local artisan groups and farmers, working to collectively put pressure on the brands to somewhat compensate their losses.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany luxury brands have been making larger donations to various charities and organisations, towards building hospitals and medical research, or provision of sanitary resources. This pandemic has split us physically, but has been inspiring and emphasizing the need to come together to have a proactive effect like never before. The industry’s profits have fallen 90% and are expected to suffer until the pandemic is not more under control, or the industry adapts and reforms for a new way of functionality. The closure of shops started to happen even before Covid-19 restrictions were put into place, many stores were looking to avoid the spread and took the measures into their own hands. As this industry is extremely reliant on people coming to the store, with 80% of transactions happening in real life. Although e-commerce has become widely popular since the lockdowns, it has not risen to the level to replace the shopping rates before, due to many reasons.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo deal with the problems head on, brands throughout the industry will have to adapt their online presence and technologies to a highly appealing level, offer the clients and experience to enjoy, besides the product. Being a highly saturated market already, the collaboration between the fashion and tech industry have been mutually propelling each other forward. While the tech field is the future in any case, the fashion industry might only have a future with the right implementation of tools that are available. As all social events have been crossed off our calendars, the fashion weeks although already not attainable to some, have actually chosen to transfer to online, virtual shows. Many brands have been using Virtual Reality to provide an unforgettable, not less than in real life experience. Although not highly accessible to all, this really goes to show how much is in store for us besides a long fill-up your cart process. Brands are being forced to look into how to get the best results, as there will never be a complete going back to how it was before with boutique shopping. With the excess stock and unsold stock, the need to interpret and serve the clients’ changing needs and desires if being highlighted, meaning that less is truly becoming more. It can be observed that throughout 2019, there have been sales up to 75% to lure in the customers, showing how much need there was for brands to efficiently make their way forward.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast-fashion has been detrimental to the planet as has become a weight on the brands since the pandemic. Trying to come out with a new fancy product and catch the clients eye has become much harder with everything moving online. The question of sustainability has been moved to our attention not as a proposition, but as a desperate demand, both from the clients and the workers, but now for the brands too. High fashion has been leading to the unsold stock, so to survive brands will have to focus their attention more on the combination of the right product with the right targeting, through an extensive use of AI. New does not scream value anymore, and being at home with not much to do and a lot of time to scroll through the offers, we are less coming across individuality. AI is giving the brands a chance to really get to know the needs of customers, thanks to the huge data, and to serve those needs on a long-term efficient basis, quality and ethicality of products is becoming the new hot seller. Although the industry has seen its downfall, it is only a call for a revolution and upgrade of approach. This pandemic has given a chance and the right push for innovation, despite the crises. What is most important, is that attention has been driven to the right areas, those that can now be developed and evolved thanks to community pressure and reform of desire, the raise of awareness and fall of attention towards the ‘new and shiny’. Behind the crises that happened so far, there was a due need for change of unstable, unsustainable systems. With their crash at a huge cost to many and in many ways, the fashion industry is at the doors of massive change, that will be beneficial for all parties involved.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The streaming service also offers you film adaptions of recent musicals, including West Side Story and everyone’s favourite musical film La La Land. Disney+ infamously landed the rights to Hamilton last year, bringing the original Broadway cast production to the small screen.
